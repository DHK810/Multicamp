                    			[woman] The game: They say a person either has what it takes to play or they don't. My mother was one of the greats. Me, on the other hand I'm kind of screwed. [grunts] [man] This is, uh Humiliating on so many levels. You have to go. Why don't you come back here, and we'll pick up where we left off? No, seriously. You have to go. l'm late. Which isn't what you want to be on your first day of work, so So, uh, you actually live here. - No. - Oh. - Yes. Kind of. - Oh. lt's nice. A little dusty, odd, but it's nice. [laughs] So, how do you kind of live here? l moved two weeks ago from Boston. lt was my mother's house. - l'm selling it. - Oh, l'm sorry. For what? You said ''was.'' Oh, my mother's not dead. She's You know what? We don't have to do the thing. Oh, we can do anything you want. No, the thing: exchange the details, pretend we care. l'm gonna go take a shower, and when l get back down here, you won't be here, so, um Goodbye, um - Derek. - Derek. - Right. Meredith. - Meredith. - Yeah. Mm-hmm. - Nice meeting you. Bye, Derek. [? Rilo Kiley: Portions For Foxes] [man] Each of you comes here today hopeful, wanting in on the game. A month ago, you were in med school being taught by doctors. Today you are the doctors. The seven years you spend here as a surgical resident will be the best and worst of your life. You will be pushed to the breaking point. Look around you. Say hello to your competition. Eight of you will switch to an easier specialty. Five will crack under the pressure. Two of you will be asked to leave. This is your starting line. This is your arena. How well you play, that's up to you. [thinking] Like I said I'm screwed. OK, Martin, Robinson, Bond, Hawkins. Only six women out of 20. Yeah. l hear one of them's a model. Seriously, that's gonna help with the respect thing? - You're Cristina, right? - [man] Patton, Monroe Which resident are you assigned to? l got Bailey. - The Nazi? Me too. - You got the Nazi? So did l. At least we'll be tortured together, right? l'm George O'Malley. Uh, we met at the, uh, mixer. You had on a black dress with a slit up the side, strappy sandals and Now you think l'm gay. No, l'm not gay. lt's it's just that, uh, you were You were very unforgettable. [man] O'Malley, Yang, Grey, Stevens. And l'm totally forgettable. - Bailey? - [man] End of the hall. That's the Nazi? [George] l thought the Nazi would be a guy. l thought the Nazi would be a Nazi. Maybe it's professional jealousy. She's brilliant and they call her a Nazi because they're jealous. - Maybe she's nice. - Let me guess. You're the model. Hi, l'm lsobel Stevens, but everyone calls me lzzie. l have five rules. Memorize them. Rule number one: Don't bother sucking up. l hate you. That's not gonna change. Trauma protocol, phone list, pagers, nurses will page you. You will answer every page at a run. A run! That's rule number two. Your first shift starts now and lasts 48 hours. You're interns, grunts, nobodies, bottom of the surgical food chain. You run labs, write orders, work every second night until you drop, and don't complain. On-call rooms. Attendings hog them. Sleep when you can where you can, which brings me to rule number three. lf l'm sleeping, don't wake me unless your patient is dying. Rule four: The dying patient better not be dead when l get there. Not only will you have killed someone, you woke me for no reason. We clear? [Bailey] Yes? You said five rules. That was only four. [pager beeping] Rule number five: When l move, you move. Get out of my way! What do we got? [man] Katie Bryce, 1 5-year-old, new onset seizures, intermittent for the past week. lV lost en route, started grand mal seizing as we descended. [Bailey] All right, get her on her side. lzzie, 1 0 milligrams Diazepam lM. No, no. The white lead is on the right. Righty, whitey, smoke over fire. A large-bore lV. Don't let the blood hemolyze. Let's go! [beeping] - [man] A wet fish on dry land? - Absolutely, Dr. Burke. Dr. Bailey, let's shotgun her. That means every test in the book: CT, CBC, chem-7, tox screen. Cristina, you're on labs. George, patient work-ups. Meredith, get Katie for a CT. She's your responsibility now. Wait. What about me? Honey, you get to do rectal exams. [? Jem: They] What are you doing here? Katie Bryce's labs came out clear. There's nothing in the results that explain her seizures. OK. Uh, l heard every year, the attending on-call picks the best intern and lets them perform a procedure during the first shift. l'm just saying it's what l heard. Go away now. - Yeah, sounds good. - He'll be fine? You'll be fine. lf you don't count the fact that my bacon days are over, sure. So bypass surgery tomorrow with Dr. Burke. l hear he's good. And, after that, you can have all the bacon-flavored soy product you can eat. Mmm. Kill me now. l wish l could, but l'm a healer. [Katie] You're lost. l'm not lost. How are you feeling? How do you think l'm feeling? - l'm missing my pageant. - You're missing your pageant? The Spokane Teen Miss. l was in the top ten after the first two rounds. This is my year. l could have won. Hello. You're so lost. What are you, like, new? OK, so l'm just gonna insert my fingers into your rectum. [inhales sharply] No. Out. Out. Bet you missed a lot when you first started out. [scoffs] l twisted my ankle in talent rehearsal. l do rhythmic gymnastics, which is, like, really cool. Nobody else does it. And l tripped over my ribbon. And l didn't get stuck with someone this clueless, and that was, like, a nurse. You and l are gonna have so much fun together. [chattering] This shift is a marathon, not a sprint. - Eat. - l can't. You should eat something. You try eating after performing The Nazi's a resident. l have attendings hating me. You know Meredith is inbred? Like it's uncommon to be a doctors' parents Royally. Her mother is Ellis Grey. Shut up. The Ellis Grey? - Who's Ellis Grey? - The Grey Method. Where'd you go to med school, Mexico? She was one of the first big chick surgeons. She's a living legend. Yeah, she won the Harper Avery twice. So l didn't know one thing. Talk about parental pressure. l'd kill to have Ellis Grey as a mother. l'd kill to be Ellis Grey. All l need is one good case. [mumbling] Katie Bryce is a pain in the ass. lf l hadn't taken the Hippocratic Oath, l'd Kevorkian her with my bare hands. What? [Burke] Good afternoon, interns. lt's posted, but l thought l'd share the good news personally. As you know, the honor of performing the first surgery is reserved for the intern that shows the most promise. As l'm running the OR today, l get to make that choice. - George O'Malley. - Me? You'll scrub in for an appendectomy this afternoon. Congratulations. Enjoy. Did he say me? [Bailey] l've seen his file. George O'Malley barely made the cut to get in this program. - He's not your guy. - He's my guy, all right. Every year, you pick your guy, and your guy suffers more than any other intern. Terrorize one, and the rest fall in line. l get it, l respect it, but George O'Malley's a puppy. Katie Bryce, 3604? - Right there. - Thank you. Katie, honey, Mom and Dad are here. They gave her a sedative for the CT scan, so she's a little groggy. [mother] Will she be all right? Our doctor said that she might need an operation. ls that true? [mother] What kind of operation? She's, um Well You know what? l'm not the doctor. Um, l'm a doctor, but l'm not Katie's doctor, so l'll go get him for you. - What? - Katie's parents have questions. Do you talk to them, or do l ask Burke? No, Burke's off the case. Katie belongs to the new attending now, Dr. Shepherd. He's over there. Meredith, can l talk to you for a second? Actually, l was Dr. Shepherd. Dr. Shepherd? This morning, it was Derek. Now it's Dr. Shepherd. We should pretend it never happened. What never happened? You sleeping with me, or you throwing me out this morning? Both are memories l'd like to hold onto. No, there will be no memories. l'm not the girl in the bar anymore, and you're not the guy. This can't exist. You get that, right? You took advantage of me, and you wanna forget. l was drunk and good-looking. You took advantage. OK, l was the one who was drunk, and you are not that good-looking. Maybe not today. Last night, l was good-looking. Had my red shirt on. - You took advantage. - l did not take advantage. Want to take advantage again? Friday night? No. You're an attending and l'm your intern. - Stop looking at me like that. - Like what? Like you've seen me naked. Dr. Shepherd, this is inappropriate. Has that ever occurred to you? [sighs] Open, identify, ligate, remove, irrigate, close. Open, identify, ligate, remove, irrigate, close. - He's gonna faint. A fainter. - No, code brown, right in his pants. He's about the flop sweat. He's gonna sweat himself unsterile. Ten bucks, he messes up the McBurney. - Fifteen, he cries. - l'll put 20 on a total meltdown. Fifty says he pulls the whole thing off. That's one of us down there, the first one of us. Where's your loyalty? l'll take that action. OK, O'Malley, let's see what you can do. Here it comes. [? O.A.O.T.S.: Dance] - Scalpel. - Scalpel. [cheers, applause] That Burke is trouble. More pressure. The human flesh is a tough shell. Dig in. - Pickups. - Pickups. - Clamp. - Clamp. [George mutters indistinct] l'm there. Damn, he got the peritoneum open. l'm out. l told you. He's gonna pull it off. - Scalpel. - Scalpel. [cheers, applause] Appendix is out. - [Burke] Not bad. - Thank you. Now all you have to do is invert the stump into the cecum and simultaneously pull up on the purse strings, but be careful not to break them. You ripped the cecum. You've got a bleeder. You're filling with stool. What do you do? Uh Think. You start the suction and you start digging for those strings before she bleeds to death. - Give him a clamp. - BP's dropping. - He's choking. - Come on, George. Today. Pull your balls out of your back pocket. Let's go. What are you waiting for? Suction. - [beeping] - [sighs] Getting too low, folks. [woman] Dr. Burke. Get out of the way. Pansy-ass idiot. Get him out of here. Suction. Clamp. He's 007. - [man 1] 007, yep. - [man 2] A total 007. - What's ''007'' mean? - License to kill. They're calling me 007, aren't they? - [both] No one's calling you 007. - Murphy whispered, ''007.'' How many times do we have to go through this? Five? Ten? Give me a number, or l'm gonna hit you. Murphy whispered, everyone laughed. - He wasn't talking about you. - Are you sure? - [Meredith] Would we lie? - Yes. Says the girl who finished first in her class at Stanford. [pager beeping] Oh, man. lt's 91 1 for Katie Bryce. l got to go. Maybe l should have gone into geriatrics. No one minds when you kill an old person. Surgery is hot. lt's the Marines. lt's macho. lt's hostile. lt's hardcore. Geriatrics is for freaks who live with their mothers and never have sex. l've got to get my own place. [chuckles] Excuse me! Excuse me! Took you long enough. You're OK? The nurse paged me 91 1 . l had to go all Exorcist to get her to even pick up the phone. [panting] Wait. There's nothing wrong with you? l'm bored. You little - l'm not a cruise director. - You don't have to wig out. The pageant's on cable, but this crappy hospital doesn't get the channel. lf that cow Kylie Wood is gonna walk off with my crown, l have to see it. Can you call someone? OK. This is an actual hospital. There are sick people here. Go to sleep and stop wasting my time. But l can't sleep. My head's all full. That's called ''thinking.'' Go with it. [woman on PA] Pain Management to 209. Pain Management to 209. What do you need? [sighs] Mr. Jones has junky veins, and he really needs antibiotics. l should start a central line. So start one. You don't know how. l've never done one. Well, you know what that means. Can't we just page someone else? She's the on-call resident. OK. OK, l'll just l'll wake her. Dr. Bailey, l don't mean to bother you. - Then don't. - lt's Mr. Jones. - ls he dying? - No. Then stop talking to me. [clears throat] [sighs] What is it?! Next time you wake me, he better be so close to dead there's a tag on his toe. Here. Take these to the lab. [man] 4-B's got post-op pneumonia. Let's start antibiotics. Are you sure that's the right diagnosis? Well, l don't know. l'm only an intern. Why don't you go spend four years in med school and then let me know if it's the right diagnosis? She's short of breath. She's got fever. She's post-op. Start the antibiotics. God, l hate nurses. l'm Alex. l'm with Jeremy. You're with the Nazi, right? She may not have pneumonia, you know. She could be splinting, or have a P.E. Like l said, l hate nurses. What did you just say? Did you just call me a nurse? Well, if the white cap fits. [pager beeping] Damn it, Katie. - ls she seeing anybody? - l don't know. [whistles] She's hot. l'm friends with her. l mean, kind of friends Not actually friends exactly, but we're tight, and we hang out. - Really, only just today - Dude. Dude, stop talking. [clamoring] What took you so long? [man] She's having multiple grand mal seizures. Now, how do you want to proceed? Dr. Grey, are you listening to me?! She's got Diazepam. Two milligrams Lorazepam. l just gave the second dose. Dr. Grey, you need to tell us what you want to do. Dr. Grey! [beeping] OK, she's full on Lorazepam? - Four milligrams. - You paged Dr. Bailey and Dr. Shepherd? Lorazepam's not working. Phenobarbital. Load her with phenobarbital. - [man] Pheno's in. - [woman] No change. - You paged Dr. Shepherd. - l just told you. - Well, page him again, stat. - What do you want to do? Dr. Grey, you need to tell us what you want to do. [flatline tone] - [man] Heart stopped. - [woman] Code blue! Code blue! Code blue! - Get the crash cart. - l'll get it, right away. Wait. - Charge the pads to 200. - Charge. Clear. [man] Still v-fib. Nothing. - Charging. - Nineteen seconds. Charge them to 300. - 300. Anything? - 27 seconds. Charge to 360. - Come on, Katie. - [woman] 49 seconds. At 60 seconds, you're supposed to admin another drug. Charge again! Charge again. Charge. - [beeping] - [Meredith] Anything? l see sinus rhythm. - Blood pressure's coming up. - All right. Pressure's returning. Rate's coming back. What the hell happened? She had a seizure and her heart stopped. - You're monitoring. - l checked. l got her. Just just go. Somebody give me her Give me her chart, please. You get a 91 1 , you page me immediately. Not in the five minutes it takes you to get to the emergency. lmmediately. You're on my team and if somebody dies, it's my ass. Grey? Meredith? [? Vaughan Penn: Ready To Rise] lf you tell anyone, ever [Mr. Bryce] You said it was a seizure disorder. - Now you're saying it isn't? - l'm saying that l don't know. - What do you think it could be? - l don't know. - When will you? - l don't have an answer. - For now, Katie is stable, and - Wait one damn minute. We came here because this hospital is supposed to be the best in Washington. That's my kid in there. My kid. And you have the audacity to stand here and tell me, ''l don't know.'' Mr. Bryce No, l want a doctor who knows what they're doing. You get me someone else, better than you. l am working hard on Katie's case. No, you're not. lf you were, you'd be able to give me some answers. [Burke] l put you on a bypass machine, which pumps blood for your heart. Fix your ticker, take you off the machine. l'm done. Simple procedure. So l shouldn't worry? l'm very good at what l do. lt still is surgery. There are some risks. l'll see you in the OR this afternoon, Mr. Savitch. You're not gonna leave me alone with that guy, are you? Oh, l'll be outside the OR the whole time. No, Dr. Burke is very good. Don't worry. l'll see you after. He'll be fine, right? Tony's gonna sail through it. You have nothing to worry about. l promise. Gotta go. - [Meredith] What are you doing? - Suturing a banana with the vain hope that it wakes up my brain. [laughing] What are you smiling at, 007? l'm sorry. l get mean when l 'm tired. You know what? l don't care. l comforted a family, and l got to hang out in the OR today. All is well. Anybody know why we're here? Good morning. - Morning. - Morning. l'm gonna do something rare for a surgeon. l'm gonna ask interns for help. l've got this kid, Katie Bryce. Right now, she's a mystery. She doesn't respond to our meds. Labs are clean, scans are pure, but she's having grand mal seizures with no visible cause. She's a ticking clock. She's gonna die if l don't make a diagnosis, which is where you come in. l can't do it alone. l need your extra minds, extra eyes. l need you to play detective. l need you to find out why Katie's having seizures. You're tired. You got more work than you could possibly handle. l understand. So l'm gonna give you an incentive. Whoever finds the answer rides with me. Katie needs surgery. You get to do what no interns get to do: Scrub in to assist on an advanced procedure. Dr. Bailey's gonna hand you Katie's chart. The clock is ticking fast. lf we're gonna save Katie's life, do it soon. [Alex] Did you just page me? [nurse] Yes. [sighs] Give antibiotics time to work. - They should have worked by now. - She's old. She's freaking ancient. She's lucky she's still breathing. l got a shot to scrub in downstairs on a patient who wasn't alive during the Civil War. Don't page me again. [woman on PA] Pain Management to 209. Pain Management to 209. Hey, l want in on Shepherd's surgery. You've been the intern on Katie since the start. Want to work together? Find the answer, we have a 50-50 chance of scrubbing in. l'll work with you, l don't want in on the surgery. lt's the biggest opportunity any intern will get. l don't want to spend time with Shepherd. What do you have against Shepherd? lf we find the answer, the surgery's yours. - Do you want to work together or not? - Deal. [Cristina] She doesn't have anoxia, renal failure or acidosis. lt's not a tumor, her CT's clean. You're not gonna tell me why you won't work with Shepherd? No. What about infection? No, there's no white count. She has no CT lesions, no fevers, nothing in her spinal tap. Just tell me. You can't comment, make a face or react in any way. We had sex. What about an aneurysm? No blood on the CT and no headaches. OK. There's no drug use, no pregnancy, no trauma. Was he good? l mean, he looks like he'd be good. Was it any good? We're out of answers. What if no one comes up with anything? You mean, what if she dies? Yeah. This is gonna sound really bad, but l really wanted that surgery. She's never gonna get the chance to turn into a person. The sum total of her existence will be almost winning Miss Teen whatever. You know what her pageant talent is? - They have talent? - Rhythmic gymnastics. [laughing] Oh, come on. What is rhythmic gymnastics? l can't even say it. l don't know what it is. [laughing] l think it's something with a ball and a What? Meredith, what? Get up. Come on. The only thing that she would possibly need is an angiogram. Oh. Oh, Dr. Shepherd, just one moment. Katie competes in beauty pageants. l know that, but we have to save her life anyway. She has no headaches, no neck pain, her CT is clean. There's no medical proof of an aneurysm, but what if she has an aneurysm anyway? - There are no indicators. - She twisted her ankle practicing. - l appreciate you trying to help - When she twisted her ankle, she fell. lt was no big deal, not even a bump on the head. She got up, iced her ankle, and everything was fine. lt was a fall so minor, her doctor didn't think to mention it when l was taking her history, but she did fall. You know what the chance is that a fall could burst an aneurysm? One in a million, literally. [woman over P.A.] Surgical scheduling is posted. [bell dings] - Let's go. - [Meredith] Where? To find out if Katie's one in a million. [sighs] l'll be damned. There it is. lt's minute, but it's there. lt's a subarachnoid hemorrhage. [Derek] She's bleeding into her brain. She could have gone through her entire life without it ever being a problem. - One tap in the right spot - [Cristina] lt exploded. Now l can fix it. You two did great work. Love to stay, but l got to tell Katie's parents she's having surgery. - Katie Bryce's chart, please. - Here you go. Dr. Shepherd, you'd said that you'd pick someone to scrub in if we helped? Oh, yes, right. Um l'm sorry l can't take you both. lt's gonna be a full house. Meredith, l'll see you in OR. Good. Thank you. Cristina [? Butterfly Boucher: Life is Short] Wow, that was quick. [Burke] His heart had too much damage for a bypass. l had to let him go. lt happens, rarely, but it does happen. The worst part of the game. But l told his wife l told Gloria that he would be fine. - l promised her that - You what? They have four little girls. This is my case. Did you hear me promise? The only one that can keep a promise like that is God, and l haven't seen him holding a scalpel lately. You never promise a patient's family a good outcome! l thought You make promises to Mrs. Savitch? You get to be the one to tell her that she's a widow. lzzie. - Maybe Meredith couldn't - lzzie. l'll tell him l changed my mind. Don't do me any favors. lt's fine. Cristina You did a cutthroat thing. Deal. Don't come to me for absolution. Want to be a shark, be a shark. - l'm not - Oh, yes you are. Only it makes you feel bad in your warm, gooey places. No, screw you. l don't get picked for surgeries 'cause l slept with my boss, and l didn't get into med school 'cause l have a famous mother. Some of us have to earn what we get. [woman over PA] Dr. Mayes to ICU. Dr. Mayes, report to ICU. Gloria, there were complications in the surgery. Tony's heart had a lot of damage. We tried to take him off bypass, but there wasn't anything we could have done. What are you talking about? He Tony died. He's dead. Gloria - l am so sorry. - Thank you. Please go away. [Gloria sobbing] [Derek] l promised l'd make her look cool. Being a bald beauty queen is the worst thing that happened in the history of the world. Did you choose me for the surgery because l slept with you? Yes. l'm kidding. l'm not gonna scrub in for surgery. You should ask Cristina. She really wants it. You're Katie's doctor. And on your first day, with little training, you helped save her life. You earned the right to follow her case through to the finish. You shouldn't let the fact that we had sex get in the way of you taking your shot. l wish l wanted to be a chef or a ski instructor or a kindergarten teacher. You know, l would have been a really good postal worker. l'm dependable. [chuckles] You know, my parents tell everyone they meet that their son's a surgeon, as if it's a big accomplishment. Superhero or something. lf they could see me now. When l told my mother l wanted to go to medical school, she tried to talk me out of it. Said l didn't have what it takes to be a surgeon, that l'd never make it. So the way l see it, superhero sounds pretty damn good. We're gonna survive this, right? She's still short of breath. Did you get an ABG or a chest film? Oh, yes, sir, l did. [Richard] And what did you see? l had a lot of patients last night. Name the common causes of post-op fever. Uh, yes. From your head, not from a book. Don't look it up. Learn it. lt should be in your head. Name the common causes of post-op fever. Uh the common causes of post Can anybody name the common causes of post-op fever? [Meredith] Wind, water, wound, walking, wonder drugs. The five W's. Most of the time, it's wind, splinting or pneumonia. Pneumonia's easy to assume, especially if you're too busy to do the tests. What do you think's wrong with 4-B? The fourth W, walking. l think she's a prime candidate for a pulmonary embolus. How would you diagnose? Spiral CT, VlQ scan, provide O2, dose with heparin and consult for an lVC filter. Do exactly as she says, then tell your resident that l want you off this case. l'd know you anywhere. You're the spitting image of your mother. Welcome to the game. [? Thirteen Senses: Into the Fire] All right, everybody. lt's a beautiful night to save lives. Let's have some fun. [Meredith] I can't think of any one reason why I want to be a surgeon but I can think of 1,000 reasons why I should quit. [Meredith] They make it hard on purpose. There are lives in our hands. There comes a moment when it's more than just a game [beeping] and you either take that step forward or turn around and walk away. [Meredith] I could quit, but here's the thing I love the playing field. - lt was a good surgery. - Yeah. We don't have to do that thing where l say something and then you say something, and then somebody cries, and there's a moment. - Yuck. - Good. You should get some sleep. You look like crap. l look better than you. That's not possible. [sighs] That was amazing. Hmm. You practice on cadavers, you observe and you think you know what you're gonna feel like standing over that table, but that was such a high. l don't know why anybody does drugs. Yeah. Yeah. l should, uh, go do this. You should. l'll see you around. See you around. See you. [Meredith] So I made it through my first shift. We all did. The other interns are all good people. You'd like them I think. I don't know, maybe. I like them. [bell jingles] Oh, and I changed my mind. l'm not gonna sell the house. l'm gonna keep it. l'll have to get a couple of roommates, but it's home, you know? Are you the doctor? No. l'm not your doctor, but l am a doctor. What's your name? lt's me, Mom. Meredith. All right. l used to be a doctor, l think. You were a doctor, Mom. You were a surgeon.

                    			[narrator] Previously on Grey's Anatomy: [Richard] The seven years here as a surgical resident will be the best and worst. You'll be pushed to the breaking point. Eight of you will switch to an easier specialty. Five crack under pressure. Two of you will be asked to leave. We should pretend it never happened. What never happened? You sleeping with me, or you throwing me out? You're an attending, and l'm your intern. Stop looking at me like that. - Like what? - Like you've seen me naked. Your first shift starts now and lasts 48 hours. You're interns, grunts, nobodies, bottom of the surgical food chain. What are you doing here? You and l are gonna have so much fun together. You know Meredith is inbred? Like it's uncommon here to be a doctor's parents. Her mother is Ellis Grey. Shut up. The Ellis Grey? She's a living legend. What's your name? lt's me, Mom. Meredith. Oh, right. We're gonna survive this, right? [? Tegan and Sara: You Wouldn't Like Me] [Meredith] It's all about lines. The finish line at the end of residency. Waiting in line for a chance at the operating table. [tires screeching] And then there's the most important line, the line separating you from the people you work with. It doesn't help to get too familiar. To make friends. You need boundaries between you and the rest of the world. Other people are far too messy. It's all about lines. Drawing lines in the sand and praying like hell no one crosses them. l'm sure you're very nice, but l'm very particular about who lives in my house. You're just not right. Why? Look, l'm quiet. No loud music, no parties. Where were you when Challenger exploded? The what? The space shuttle. Challenger. Uh, l think l was in kindergarten. Exactly. No. [lzzie] Why put up posters if you don't want roommates? l do want roommates. We're together 1 00 hours a week. You want to live together too? l see you bring bribes now. l need a place to live. My mom irons my scrubs. l have to get out of there. lt's not a bribe. l don't think it's a good idea. - l can put down last - lt's totally a bribe. l can cook, and l'm an obsessive cleaner. [Meredith] No. l just want two total strangers who l don't have to talk to or be nice to. And it's not a bribe. lt's a mocha latte. George, run the code team. Meredith, take the trauma pager. Cristina, deliver the labs to the patients. lzzie, you're on sutures. Dr. Bailey, l was hoping to assist you in the OR today. Maybe do a minor procedure. l think l'm ready. Mocha latte? [Cristina] lf she gets to cut, l want to cut. - [lzzie] Me too. - l wouldn't mind another shot. Stop talking. Every intern wants to perform their first surgery. That's not your job. Do you know what your job is? To make your resident happy. Do l look happy? No. Why? Because my interns are whiny. You know what will make me look happy? Having code team staffed, having the trauma pages answered, having the weekend labs delivered and having someone down in the pit doing the sutures. No one holds a scalpel till l'm so happy l'm Mary-freakin'-Poppins. Mocha latte, my ass. Why are y'all standing there? Move! Seattle has ferryboats. - Yes? - l didn't know that. l've been living here six weeks. l didn't know there were ferryboats. Seattle is surrounded by water on three sides. - Hence the ferryboats. - [elevator bell dings] Now l have to like it here. l wasn't planning on liking it here. l'm from New York. l'm genetically engineered to dislike everywhere, except Manhattan. l have a thing for ferryboats. l'm not going out with you. Did l ask you to go out with me? Do you want to go out with me? l'm not dating you, and l'm definitely not sleeping with you again. - You're my boss. - l'm your boss's boss. You're my teacher and my teacher's teacher. And you're my teacher. ''l'm your sister. l'm your daughter.'' - You're sexually harassing me. - l'm riding an elevator. Look, l'm drawing a line. The line is drawn. There's a big line. So, this line, is it imaginary, or do l need to get you a marker? [dings] [clears throat] We'll talk later? [beeping] - Are you the surgeon? - Yeah. We've got a rape victim. Better get in there. [woman] 25-year-old female found down at the park. Status: post-trauma. She came in with a GCS of six. BP: 80 over 60. Exam is significant for blunt head trauma. Unequal breath sounds, right pupil is dilated. And she's ready for X-ray. Ready to roll? - Hey! - Yeah. Call ahead to clear CT. Let them know l'm coming. Load up the portable monitor. Call Respiratory for a ventilator. l'll get x-rays while l'm down there. She's going to spend a long time in recovery and rehab. lf she survives. [Derek] ls she 5'2'', 1 00 pounds? She's breathing after what this guy did? Catch the guy, they should castrate him. [Burke] See how shredded her hands are? - She tried to fight. - Tried? Rape kit came back negative. She kicked his ass. So we have a warrior among us, huh? [chuckles] Allison. Her her name is Allison. Allison. [Burke] l think l may have found the cause of our rupture. Large hemostat. [Burke] More suction. What is this? Does anyone know what this is? Oh, my God. What? Spit it out, Grey. - She bit it off. - Bit off what? That's h-his penis. She bit off his his penis. [? Psapp: Nobody Knows] Ouch! lf she can fight the infection, she'll be fine. lt's all gonna depend on whether or not she wakes up in the next 72 hours. We should get a drink later. You can tell me the long story, what makes a doc leave the Big Apple for Seattle. Short story, actually. Your chief of surgery made me an offer l couldn't refuse. Richard asked you to come? Yeah. Why? Oh, nothing. See you later. Do you know what the code team does? Saves lives. l shock a heart, and someone lives to see another day. That's upbeat. lt's, uh, glass half full. Bambi, don't say another word till after the hunter shoots your mother. l don't like you. l have a BA from Smith, a PhD from Berkeley and an MD from Stanford, and l'm delivering lab results. lt will take all day to get through these. Then get started. Oh, l-l wasn't complaining. lntern was reassigned, so he's mine now. Have him shadow you for the day. Show him how l do things. Alex Karev. Nice to meet you. You're the pig who called Meredith a nurse. l hate you on principle. And you're the pushy, overbearing kiss-ass. l, uh, l hate you too. Oh, it should be fun then. [pager beeping] l'm Dr. O'Malley. l'll be running this code. What do we got? [man] We have a 57-year-old male. He's asystole. Charging to 200, please. - We're charged. - Cleared. All right, Mrs. Lu, l'm Dr. Stevens. l'm gonna sew up your wound. You're gonna need about six stitches. Are you allergic to any medication? [speaking Chinese] Oh, l'm sorry. l-l don't Do you speak English? [speaking Chinese] l'll find, um Does anybody here speak Chinese? [knocks on door] Hi. ls the chief in? He's on his way. ls that it? - Yeah. - Can l see it? No. Forget l asked. Meredith, it's good to see you. l heard your mother was leaving Mayo. She going back with the UN? - She's, uh, taking time off. - To write another book, l suppose. So they said to bring this to you, so - Yes, uh, for the police. - Right. When did the police say they were coming? You know how slow they are. She better take it with her. What? You have to take it with you. Chain-of-custody rules. All medical matter in a rape must stay with the person who collected it until it's placed in police custody. You collected the specimen, so you have custody. Custody of a penis. Yes, until the cops come for it. OK. Well, what am l supposed to do with the penis? [Cristina] You have a disorder called multinucleate cell angiohistiocytoma. lt's not a cancer or sarcoma. lt's very rare but minor. You'll be discharged today, OK? - l-l don't need a surgery? - No. l'm not gonna die? l'm fine? Fit as a fiddle, or whatever. [sobbing] What's that? Don't ask. You don't want to know. l do want to know. Really. You really want to know? lt's a severed penis. OK. l didn't really want to know. [Cristina] Why do l have to be the one who get hugged? [Alex] Because l don't do that. Besides, you're the ovarian sister here. Did you call me an ovarian s? An ovarian s? Since when has the possession of ovaries become an insult? Meredith's carrying a penis around in a jar. - Oh, from the rape surgery? - Yeah, and it's not a jar. lt's a cooler. Talk about taking a bite out of crime. [woman over PA] Wheelchair to Admitting. - You OK? - Yeah. - Allison's shoes are - What? The rape victim, Allison, her shoes. l have the same ones in my locker, and l normally never wear them because they're not comfortable. But today l did. And she was wearing the same shoes, and it's just stupid, and l'm tired, and forget it. You know what you need? No. lt's sick and twisted. We said last time was the last time. You've been doing it without me? Nancy Reagan lied. You can't just say no. Come on. Do you know what would happen if anyone knew? l'm doing it. You can come with me, or you can stay here and be miserable. [chuckles] [cooing] [George talking gibberish] [laughs] You are such a woman. - [Meredith clears throat] - [pager beeping] That's a code. - [pager beeping] - l got to go. [sighs] You are really cute. [crying] [crying continues] [cooing] What are you doing in here? There were no tests ordered, and the baby has a murmur. l know. He turned blue. You're not authorized to be in here. Do you know how much trouble you can get into? Are you going to do any tests? lt's a benign systolic ejection murmur. lt goes away with age. - You're not gonna do tests? - He's not your patient. - He's not even on your service. - You sure it's benign? l'm a doctor, too, you know. You should get out of here. [speaking Chinese] - You get a good case? - No, her. She won't let me sew her up. [speaking Chinese] l wouldn't have called you, but l can't get the translator. Can you just ask her what's wrong? - No. - Why not? Because l grew up in Beverly Hills. The only Chinese l know is from a Mr Chow's menu. Besides, l'm Korean. [sighs] Chief. So, you asked Shepherd to come to Grace, huh? He was an old student of mine. He left a Manhattan private practice because you asked. - Yes. - No other reason? Just a favor for an old professor? lt'll be years before l retire. Chief of Surgery is mine. Chief of Surgery is mine. lt was yours. Now l'm not so sure. l am the best surgeon at Grace with the lowest mortality rate. You can't just bring Now ask me why l'm not so sure about you. Ask me why. [woman on PA] OB nurse to Labor and Delivery. Available OB nurse to Labor and Delivery. Don't people get sick anymore? l mean, how are we supposed to get any OR time if everyone's gonna just live? Look. l'll take ten, you take ten. Get in, get out. No smiling, no hugging, no letting them cry. - Just be quick about it. - You're the one that's slow. l am not slow. You are slow. - You want to bet? - You're on. [? The Ditty Bops: Sister Kate] - A comprehensive workup - Did not reveal Your Doppler was negative. So there's no need for chronic anticoagulation. - [Cristina] lBC - [Alex] Biopsy was positive - for a mixed anaerobic - streptococci infection. Creatinine elevations had us worried about glomerulonephritis which could signal autoimmune disease. What does that mean? - We're not amputating your leg. - Huh? You keep your kidneys. Congratulations. You can go home today. Congratulations. Whatever. There's nothing wrong with you. You're going to be fine. Congratulations. [beeping] [Meredith] What's your favorite '80s group? - Queen. - No. - Twisted Sister. - Oh! lt's not like there's a right or wrong answer. The Go-Go's, Duran Duran, Eurythmics. - Have a nice day. - You can go home today. [flatline tone] Time of death: 1 5:45. Meredith. l've called every hospital in the county. l don't know. Sooner or later, the guy that did this is gonna seek medical attention. When he does, that penis you're carrying is going to nail him. - Where is her family? - Doesn't have any. No siblings? No. Both parents are dead. She just moved to Seattle three weeks ago. Welcome to the city. Meredith, are you OK? Yeah, l'm fine. l just have to do something. l have to go. All right. l'm going to sit with her. Dr. Burke? There's a baby up in Peds. l saw him have a tet spell, and l think l hear a murmur. Hmm. Did Peds call us for a consult? - No, they're not - So, you want me to what? lf you could just go up and look at him. Not without a Peds consult. l'm a busy man, Grey, and there are rules. Look, it's not like l'm the chief or something. [exhales] You're hot. You're drunk. Hold still. Wait. You're that that girl from the magazine. The red bikini. Yeah, it was pink. l'm done. You can see the nurse outside now. [speaking Chinese] - ls she crazy or something? - No, l don't think so. OK. Please. Please sit down. l really need to look at your arm. OK. [speaking Chinese] What are you doing down here? Just sitting here with my penis. - What about you? - Hiding from Alex. l kissed Derek. You kissed Derek? ln the elevator. ln the elevator? l was having a bad day. l am having a bad day. This is what do you do on your bad days, make out with Dr. McDreamy. Well, you know, that and carrying around a penis just makes everything seem so shiny and happy. George said Allison was wearing your shoes. Yeah. lt's weird, right? lt's weird that you care. - l think it's weird. - [shouting] [tires screeching] Could l have Security, please? What do we got? - Take a look. - What? Let's get him to OR 1 . Call the chief. Let him know we got the rapist. l saw Allison. You can't believe the beating that she took. And then to see this. Like that saying, ''You should see the other guy.'' Why not attempt to reattach the penis? Teeth don't slice. You can only reattach with a clean cut. lf she wanted to slice him off with a knife The digestive juices didn't leave much of the flesh. So, what do we do? Sew him up minus part of the family jewels. And his outlook? He'll be urinating out of a bag for a long time. Not to mention he'll never be able to have sex again. - Too bad. - Shame. Let's all take a moment to grieve. Clamp. Richard. We got the rapist. He stumbled right into the hospital. Yeah, l heard. - Listen, Burke - Why? You really want to know? l want to know when you stopped thinking of me as your number one. Richard, l do more in this hospital than You do only exactly as much as is necessary. You never take an extra step. You never give an extra minute. You're comfortable and arrogant, and it doesn't impress me. You want to be chief? Earn it. [speaking Chinese] l'm sorry. l have patients lined up. l don't have time. l don't understand you. l'm sorry. [woman on PA] Dr. Bailey to Ortho, stat. - My head hurts. - Maybe it's a tumor. You wish l had a tumor. l'd rip your face off if it meant l got to scrub in. l've been suturing all day. My hands are numb. At least you help people. At least you get to practice freakin' medicine. l had to send my Chinese lady away. She was, like, camped out down there. Oh, poor lzzie, turning away patients. Boohoo. The police can't send a crime-scene guy down for hours, so l have to spend the night with the penis. - Alex, don't say it. - lt was too easy, anyway. [sighs] Who here feels like they have no idea what they're doing? Are we supposed to be learning something? l don't feel like l'm learning anything. Except how not to sleep. lt's like there's this wall. The attendings and the residents are over there being surgeons, and we're over here being Suturing, code-running, lab-delivering penis minders. l hate being an intern. [baby crying] - Hi. - Hi. - ls he yours? - Yeah. - He's adorable. - Thanks. Oh, please. You are so out of line. She says the murmur might not be benign. l think we should do an echo to check. This is your career. There really is no reason to get alarmed. What's the problem? lf our baby is sick, we want him treated. - Now. - Who said your baby was sick? The surgical intern, who has no business on our service. Who authorized you? - l was just - l did. Can you excuse us for a second? Dr. Burke. Are you messing with my intern, Dr. Kay? No, sir. Give me the chart. There's nothing wrong with him. l checked. - Are you sure? - Yes. You can guarantee he's fine? You're 1 00 percent sure? - How sure are you? - l don't know, 75 percent? Not good enough. He's my patient now. That OK with you, Dr. Kay? - Absolutely. - He can take our patient? He's an attending. Which means l can do whatever l want. Mr. and Mrs. Johnson, l'm Dr. Burke, head of Cardio. We're going to run some tests and give you an answer within the hour. - Grey. Excuse me. - Yes, Dr. Burke. l want an EKG, chest x-ray and an echo. - l don't have all day. - You're a busy man. l'm a busy man. - [exhales] Anybody else? - No. No more. l need a bed. Ms. Lu? [thunder rumbling] Ms. Lu! Ms. Lu, wait! Ms. Lu! What is it? [speaking Chinese] Hello? [sirens wailing in distance] Oh, my God. lt's OK. lt's OK. l'll help, OK? [thunder crashes] lt's deep. lt's deep. l need to clean it out. Machine broke in the factory. - lt fall. - You speak English. Just lf you could come inside. No, no, no inside. No Jail. Jail? She came inside. She green card. Me, no. You're illegal. That's OK. We don't have to tell them that. l just need to get you inside. l have to sew - No inside. - Please, l promise. l promise you won't go to jail. Just lt's raining. Please come inside. [speaking Chinese] OK, OK, OK. Not inside. Uh Wait here, OK? Wait. l'll come back. l'll be back. - Well? - lt's a birth defect. Tetralogy of Fallot with pulmonary atresia. You were right. l'm booking the OR for tomorrow. Thank you for backing me up on this. Whoa. Wait. You were right. But if you ever pull a stunt like that again, going to the parents behind a doctor's back, trying to steal a patient from another service, l will make your residency here hell on Earth. [? The Cardigans: Live and Learn] Three, four, five. Breathe. Charging to 200, please. Four, five. Breathe. Damn it. OK. You're all sewn up. That's pretty good. l could've done a better job if l'd had more light. You might have a scar. lt is good. You're going to need to come back in five days. l'm going to need to check the wound and remove the stitches. OK? Here's my pager number on this card. Right here, OK? We'll meet right back here, OK? You have to come back. But you can't tell anybody that l helped you outside of the hospital, or l might lose my job. Understand? Yes. Come back and don't tell. Yes. OK, that's it. l'm done. You can go. l'll see you in five days. See you. [speaking Chinese] Thank you. [? Get Set Go: Wait] - Do you think l'm too confident? - No. Don't lie. You are my boss. All right, then. Anything you say in the next l think you're cocky, arrogant, bossy and pushy. You also have a God complex. You never think about anybody but yourself. - But - l have 22 more seconds. l'm not done. [Cristina] l need a drink, a man or a massage. Or a drunken massage by a man. What's wrong with you? l lost five patients on the code team today. l feel like the angel of death. George, 95 percent of all code patients can't be revived. Most of them are seriously dead before you even get there. What? Why didn't you tell me that when l was going on and on about how great it was going to be? Because you're George and l'm Cristina. [woman] His heart surgery is scheduled for the morning. l really did think l was right, you know? l know. We almost never are. We're interns. We're not supposed to be right. And when we are, it's completely shocking. Are you? l mean, being an intern, do you feel? Terrified. Good. lt's not just me. No. How is she? No change. - Have you been here all night? - Mm-hmm. Yep. You know, l have four sisters. Very girly. Tons of kids. lf l was in a coma, they'd all be here. l'd want them here. Having no one? Can't imagine that. l can. What about your mother? She'd be here ordering all the surgeons around. She'd fly these cowboys in from Prague to do these amazing medical procedures. That's true. l do have my mother. So we're kissing, but we're not dating? l knew that was going to come up. Don't get me wrong. l like the kissing. l'm all for the kissing. More kissing, l say. - l have no idea what that was about. - ls it gonna happen again? Because if it is, l need to bring breath mints. - Put a condom in my wallet. - Shut up now. There's this baby up in the nursery. He's brand-new. No one's neglected him or damaged him yet. How do we get from there to here? She's wearing my shoes, and someone's beat the crap out of her. And she's got nobody. [monitor beeping] Her lCP's doubled. Get OR! Prep for craniotomy. Let's hang a mannitol. Take a blood gas. [woman over PA] Dr. Cutler to Thoracic surgery. Hey. l, uh, had to leave her skull flap off until the pressure in her brain goes down. She's not going to make it, is she? She's going to be fine. lf she ever wakes up. lf she ever wakes up. [Derek] Dr. Burke? l'm off at 6:00. You want to get that drink? - l don't think so. - What about tomorrow? Shepherd, you should know that Richard promised chief to both of us. But you knew that already. Keep your friends close and your enemies closer. You're not the enemy. You're just the competition. So here is where you have the signature, and down here, the initials. OK. lt just says that the, um The Penis. [laughs] Look, l'm a doctor. l mean, it shouldn't be weird to say this. lt's just that l used to change her diapers. l get it. lt just says that it was never out of your sight. - One penis. - Yeah. Officer. [Burke] We'll use a median approach for a transventricular repair with a right ventriculotomy. Let's open him up. OK. Fifteen blade, please. - Grey? - Yes, sir? Go scrub in. When we're finished cracking the baby's chest, l'll let you hold the clamp. Seriously? Don't make me change my mind. l'm going. [? Keane: Somewhere Only We Know] l have good news and bad news. Good news is Dr. Bailey stopped your bleeding. The bad news is we're giving your penis to the cops. Have a nice life. [Cristina] The results of your labs are clean. The tumor is benign. You can go home today. Oh, you [Meredith] At some point, you have to make a decision. Boundaries don't keep other people out. They fence you in. Life is messy. That's how we're made. OK, fine, George and lzzie, you can move into the house. - Yes! - l can't believe you caved! Thank you. Yes! l can't believe l caved. l blame the babies. They make you toxic. [Meredith] So you can waste your life drawing lines or you can live your life crossing them. Welcome back. [Meredith] But there are some lines So, it's intense. This thing l have for ferryboats, l mean. [Meredith]that are way too dangerous to cross. l'm so taking the stairs this time. No self-control. lt's sad. Really. [Meredith] Here's what I know. If you're willing to take the chance the view from the other side is spectacular.

                    			[? The Ditty Bops: There's a Girl] [Meredith] We live out our lives on the surgical unit. Seven days a week, 1 4 hours a day. We're together more than we're apart. Aah! George's room is bigger than mine. [sighing] [thudding] Augh! After a while - l should have the bigger room. - the ways of residency - l got here first. - Meredith should decide. become the ways of life. [George] My room is two inches bigger. - Number one - [lzzie] You have a bigger closet. - Why is everything a competition? - Always keep score. Number two: Do whatever you can to outsmart the other guy. Everywhere else is filled with Meredith's mom's boxes. Meredith? When is your mom coming back to town, anyway? [George] Maybe we can put her boxes in storage. [lzzie] Unpack a few things, make this place more homey. Some throw pillows, lamps, a few paintings. [George] Paintings would be nice. You have this amazing stuff packed away. l found this box with tapes of your mother performing amazing medical procedures. We should watch them. Do you want to watch? Meredith, do you want some privacy? [sighing] Number three: Don't make friends with the enemy. - Morning, Dr. Bailey. - Shut up. You realize that l'm an attending, and you're only a resident. - That you work for me? - l know l've forgotten something. Something is happening today. l know l should know what it is, but l just can't - Nice talking with you, Dr. Bailey. - lt's in front of my face. - [gasps] Doctor! - Whoo-hoo! [horns honking] Whoo! Augh! Now l remember. [horns honking] [Bailey] Watch out. Watch out. Ooh! Whoa! Fools on bikes, killing themselves. Natural selection is what it is. So, what's up with the Nazi? ls she off her meds? You never heard of the race? [Richard] Excellent board, well-timed, balanced, efficient. lf all goes well, we'll have an early night. Chief, Dead Baby Bike Race started 20 minutes ago. All right, people! Dead Baby Bike Race day! - Every year, this bar - The Dead Baby bar. Every year, they hold this underground bike race. You wonder why someone would name a bar something so disgusting? Keep your panties on, Nancy Drew. - The race is completely illegal and - Crazy. Bike messengers racing against traffic, trying to beat each other for free shots of tequila. No-holds-barred competition, sounds like fun. The race doesn't even have any rules, except eye-gouging. No eye-gouging. We'll be trapped in the pit Band-Aiding idiots when we could be up in the OR. What kind of people engage in a race that has, as its only rule, that you can't rip out the eyeballs of another human being? Men, Georgie. Men. [Bailey] l need someone to get up to the OR floor. The chief needs a right hand. [Meredith] Oh, and yeah, number four [sighing] George. [all sigh] Everything, everything, is a competition. OK, people. The rules of trauma. Don't mingle with the ER interns. They don't know their ass from esophagus. Sew fast, discharge faster. Get bodies up to the OR. And don't let me catch you fighting over patients. Got it? Come on, let's go. Oh, it's like candy, but with blood, which is so much better! - Oh, my God. - Mine. No! l saw him first! [Meredith] Whoever said winning wasn't everything Ooh. l'll take that guy. You'll have to beat me to him first. never held a scalpel. [? Psapp: Nobody Knows] Heads, he's mine. Tails, he's yours. Why do you get to be ''heads''? l have a head, and honey, you are a tail. Excuse me. How do you manage to make everything dirty? Ha! Tails. There are plenty of other cases. So, go get one. l was here first. l am not backing down so l can do sutures all day while you're in the OR. This is a surgical case, and you know it. lt's superficial. lt's cool, but it's superficial. You know those things didn't rupture his peritoneum? Because he's sitting up and he's talking to us. Hello. Excuse me, l was wondering if you could take these out and sew me up, so l could go and win my race. - We can't just pull them out - [grunts] - We have to do some tests - Ow, wicked. [Meredith] Are you out of your mind? lt's a superficial wound. Sew him up and let him finish his race. Hey, good man. [Cristina] John Doe, mid-30s pedestrian, hit by a motorist swerving to avoid a bike. GCS 3. Pupils fixed and dilated. Atropine given for a pulse in the 40s. BP 1 83 over 1 1 2. Pulse-ox 98 percent. Chest showed widened mediastinum and head CT revealed cerebral edema. He's gotten 70 of mannitol, dexamethasone 1 0 - and a gram of phenytoin. - Give him to the OR? - ls he gorked? - Looks like. [Burke] The bike race claims its first victim. l'll make my AAA repair after all. Uh, Dr. Shepherd? He's not going to the OR? No. Do an EEG and confirmatory tests. lf he doesn't respond in six hours, declare him. - Declare him? Declare him what? - Brain-dead. [sighs] Sir, Dr. Bailey sent me. Should l scrub in? No. l'm stuck here all day. l need you on the floor, - monitoring pre and post-op patients. - Oh. - You got a problem with that, O'Malley? - Oh, uh, no, sir. A buddy of mine in 4451 , Lloyd Mackie. Give him whatever he needs. Yes, sir. [O'Malley] Mr. Mackie No smoking! - There's no smoking. - Why not? Oh, my God You're in a hospital! Your point being? l don't know if you've listened to the surgeon general lately, say, in the past 20 years, but smoking is bad. Smoking will kill you. Liver cancer will kill me. Smoking will just speed up the process. You're at the top of the donor list for a new liver. There's hope. Sweetheart, l've been at the top of the list for eight months. l'm not in a batter's cage. l'm in a dugout, about to be traded. - You like baseball? - No. Oh. Um, well, um, the chief wanted me to look in on you. Hmm. Richard's a dear old friend. He's been my doctor for 30 years. Well, whatever you need, l'm your man. Just name it. Well l'm sure l'll think of something. - [machine beeping] - Absent corneal reflexes. lt's been 55 minutes. lf he doesn't respond to tests in the next five hours, what? We stand here and watch him die? [Cristina] lf he doesn't respond to tests, it's because he's already dead. [scoffing] Technically. Legally. - Actually, lzzie. Actually dead. - He's breathing. He has a heartbeat. Look at his EEG. There's no higher-brain function. He'll never talk, move or think again. There's no one in there. Think like a doctor, lzzie. He could wake up. What about a miracle? [lzzie] There are medical miracles, you know. l know. You're right, miracles happen. [Derek] People do wake up. That's why we do a series of tests over a number of hours. So when we call time of death, we know that we've done everything to make sure it's actually his time of death. That there isn't gonna be any miracles. This is the hard part. To stand around as surgeons and not cut. That's what ''do no harm'' means. l wish he'd just go into the light already so l can get on another case. Oh, l'm the devil because l'd rather be in surgery instead of standing watch over the death squad? lt's depressing. Look at his sneakers. They're brand-new. And somebody sewed this tear in his shirt. And he has one of those electronic key cards. He belongs to someone. An hour ago, he was out there, alive. To simply stand here and wait for him to die - lt would be a waste of life. - Exactly. lt'd be a waste of organs. Ahh. You've got a nice touch. [sighs] And, by the way, you are a rockin' babe. Seriously, do you actually think you have a shot here? l'd like to think l've got a shot anywhere. - Hmm. - Hmm. Look, you really have to let me take you for some tests. You could have internal bleeding. No, thank you, l've got a race to get back to. Why? You can't win now, anyway. Doesn't mean l can't cross that finish line. There's a party at the finish line. Do you want to meet me there? One test. A CT. l'll have you out of here in an hour. l can't do it. Got to go. [groaning] Well, you realize you're leaving against medical advice, and that l strongly urge you to stay. The frat guy said l could go. The frat guy is an ass. OK, well, you have to sign an AMA form. Darling, l will do anything you want me to. What is it with you guys and your need to dirty everything up? l don't know. Maybe it's just testosterone, eh? Maybe. You might want to see a doctor about that too. Come here. [grunting] [sighing] That was for good luck. Don't worry, darling, you'll see me again. For your sake, l hope not. [door closing] [sighing] What do you want? You make out with patients now? What, are you jealous? l don't get jealous. - We had sex, once. - And we kissed in an elevator. And we kissed in an elevator, once. - No, seriously. Go out with me. - No. You know, l almost died today. Yeah, l came, like, this close. How would you feel if l died and you didn't get a chance to go out with me? - Get over yourself, already. - Come on. - lt's the chase, isn't it? - What? The thrill of the chase. l've been wondering to myself, ''Why are you so hell-bent on getting me to go out with you?'' You know you're my boss, you know it's against the rules, you know l keep saying no. lt's the chase. Well, it's fun, isn't it? You see? This is a game to you. But not to me. Because, unlike you, l still have something to prove. [Bailey] l know you see me resecting this bowel. Do l strike you as someone who enjoys multitasking? We have a John Doe. ln three hours, we have to declare him. - We want to harvest his organs. - Why are you wasting time? You know how many patients we have downstairs. lf he dies, and he could still live, his death should mean something. And you want a harvest surgery. - l want to save lives. - [Bailey scoffs] OK, l want a harvest surgery. Getting organs from a John Doe is a long shot. Without lD, you can't contact the family. Without the family, you can't get consent. Let the poor man die in peace. What if we can find the family? - [Bailey] And get consent. - We could harvest the organs? lf you find the family. What are you doing? Hiding. There's this VlP patient He likes me. That's good, right? He ''likes me,'' likes me. Go for it, man. Get yours. l'm down with the rainbow. Oh. Are you not gay? - No. - Really? Dude, sorry. Uh, Cristina? Do you? Do you think? Does Meredith think l'm gay? Are you? - No. - Really? [lzzie] Hey, l found this on our John Doe. lt's a hotel key card. The police are going to send someone over, figure out what hotel he was staying at, get his lD from there. - l'll make sure the police get it. - lt's really important. We only have a few hours before we have to declare him, and l'd really like to find his family. You want their permission for organ donation? l just really want to find them. You have a potential donor? What's his blood type? Uh, O-neg. [breathing apparatus hissing] [monitor beeping] OK. l know you probably can't hear me, and you're feeling this big push to go towards the light, where everything's all halos and all-you-can-eat buffets and stuff. And, l mean, sharing your organs is really great and all. But l think you have a family. l can feel it. So l think it'd be really great if you could do me a favor, and get better. Just live. So, you think you can give that a shot for me? [monitor beeping rapidly] [monitor beeping rapidly] Oh, no. Meredith! - Meredith. He's crashing. - What? What are you doing? Call a code! l can't, l'm not supposed to. He's brain-dead. lf he's brain-dead, you have to let him go. No. lt's only been five hours and 33 minutes. He's supposed to get six hours. We can't do anything. lt's not our place to make that call. He's a person. We're doctors. We should have every right to make that call. We can't just stand here and do nothing while he dies. He has a right to the next 27 minutes. Screw it. l'll get the dopamine. You get the blood. We'll transfuse him. [George] Do you feel any pain here? No. You know, you really do have beautiful eyelashes. Um Thank you. Uh, what about here? No. And nice eyes. Kind. l like a man with kind eyes. Really? You think l have kind eyes? Mmm. l mean, uh You can, um What are you examining me for? Oh, you know, just routine medical stuff. You're doing very well. Because l'm enjoying the view. OK. Well l gotta go. - He's stable. - For now. l had a radiologist look at his chest. He has a traumatic aortic injury. - He's gonna rupture and bleed out. - He needs surgery. - lf he's gonna remain an organ donor. - lf he's gonna live. - lzzie - No, l'm not giving up on him. He has surgery, he lives. That's the point. l'm going to find the family. You get him into surgery. She's vice president of Fantasyland. So who do we go to for the surgery. Bailey? We need to go higher than Bailey. Dr. Burke. - Hello! - OK. [sighing] Dr. Burke, um, l know you're busy, but our John Doe needs an aortic repair. The guy from this morning? lsn't he legally dead? Well, yeah He's kinda still around. We gave him two units PRVCs and put him on pressors. On whose orders? [Meredith] Mine. You get a brain-dead John Doe a blood transfusion without consulting anyone. And now you want me to repair his heart? Well, yes. You do enjoy crossing the line, don't you? He is an excellent candidate for organ donation. l am a surgeon. l save lives. This guy is already dead. Now, this is the men's room. Either whip one out, or close the door. - You're asking my advice? - Yes. Now who's chasing? - Not funny. This is important. - OK. You want to get around Burke? You gotta find a way to get the chief involved. What'd l do? How close a match for the liver is your guy to our John Doe? Very. Same type, same size. Couldn't find a better match. Why? He's the chief's VlP, right? Right. How much would you kill to be in on the transplant surgery? You underestimate me. l'm not a baby. l'm your colleague. You don't have to manipulate me. lf you want something, all you have to do is ask. We want you to go over Burke's head, to the chief. Ask me something easier. Sir. - O'Malley. How's Mackie? - Fine. Actually, that's what l want to talk to you about. l kinda think that Me and the other interns We think O'Malley, l'm not getting any younger. We found Mackie a liver. [Meredith] We are so going to hell. - Burke is sending us to hell. - On an express train. lf it works. What are you doing? [all] Nothing. Yes! [laughing] Oh, crap. Dr. Burke! Dr. Burke! [monitor beeping] [Alex] Excellent work, sir. Excellent. Flawless. lt's a shame he's brain-dead. lf he wasn't, he would be on his feet in a few days. l'm amazed at what's going on. l seriously hate that guy. Alex is vermin. That surgery is ours. [lzzie] At least Burke is doing the surgery. l don't care about Alex. George, you did good. l'm gonna have to dodge Burke for the rest of my career. He could kill me and make it look like an accident. [door opening] The police called. They've identified your John Doe. His wife is on the way. [all sigh] [monitor beeping] Oh, my God. [exhales] Kevin! - [Derek] lt's OK. - [woman] Oh, my God! Mrs. Davidson, this is Dr. Stevens. Now, if you have any questions at all, please call me. ls there? ls there still a chance? We can hold off till morning, but if there's still no change, we'd We'd like to talk to you about organ donation. [monitor continues beeping] [Richard] Mackie? Mmm. How are we treating ya? Oh, fine. Except that beautiful boy won't let me smoke. [Mackie] You should reprimand him. Make him change bedpans. [laughing] Mackie. That beautiful boy may have found you a liver. [sobs] [? Tegan and Sara: I Won't Be Left] [pager beeping] God, l smell good! You know what it is? lt's the smell of open-heart surgery. [sniffing] lt's awesome. lt is awesome. You gotta smell me. l don't want to smell you. Oh, yes you do. You have got to be kidding me! OK, l have more important things to deal with than you. l have roommates, boy problems and family problems. Wanna act like a frat-boy bitch? That's fine. You wanna take credit for your saves, and everybody else's? That's fine too. - Just stay outta my face. - [door opening] And for the record, you smell like crap! [sighing] She attacked me. Meredith! Meredith! Meredith! Meredith! You might want to leave before l change my mind, and let her beat you to a pulp with her tiny, ineffectual fists. [sighing] What? Nothing. lt's just Nothing. Oh! This one is skin grafting! Skin grafting? No way! l've never seen that done. Are those my mother's surgical tapes? We should watch the skin grafting one first. Where did all this stuff come from? Oh. l unpacked some of your mother's things. l was upset. And when l'm upset, l like to nest. Oh Hemipelvectomy! l think we should watch this one first. No. We're not watching my mother's surgery tapes. We're not unpacking boxes. We're not having conversations where we celebrate the moments of our lives. And use a coaster! - l ordered Chinese food. - [Meredith] l hate Chinese food! [door slamming] They're everywhere. All the time. lzzie's perky, and George does this thing where he's helpful and considerate. They share food, and they say things, and they move things and they breathe. - Ugh. They're, like, happy. - Kick them out. l can't. They just moved in. l asked them to move in. So you're gonna repress everything in a deep, dark, twisted place until, one day, you snap and kill them? Yep. This is why we are friends. Why is the Nazi making us stay in the pit two days in a row? - [Meredith] Leftovers. - Leftovers. Gotta get the cyclists who were too drunk, stupid or scared to get to a hospital yesterday. She gets to do a freakin' organ harvest. - Kills you, doesn't it? - What? Two women caught the harvest. No, it kills me that anybody got the harvest but me. Boobs do not factor into this equation. Unless, uh, you want to show me yours. - l'm gonna become a lesbian. - [Cristina] Me too. [elevator bell dings] [Cristina] Now, Mrs. Davidson, this form simply says you consent to the donation of your husband's major organs. Heart, lungs, liver and kidneys. [sighing] Now, l need to ask you a few questions. Are you willing to donate his corneas? You want his eyes? Um, corneal transplants can give someone back their sight. l suppose that's OK. [sighing] What about his skin? What? [clears throat] lt's used to help burn victims. You want to cut off his skin? What about the funeral? You want me to have a funeral and have people look at him Have his daughter look at her father and he doesn't have any skin? lt's his skin! [sobbing] What are you doing? - l'm not a people person. - No kidding. l can't do that. l can't talk to the families of patients. l'm sorry. - What's his name? - Who? The patient. What's his name? - Kevin Davidson. - Remember that. Not ''gorked guy.'' Not ''John Doe.'' Kevin Davidson. He's someone's husband, someone's son, not a collection of body parts for you to harvest. A person. Now, no one said this was easy. l owe you, George. No, you don't owe me anything. l'm just happy we found a liver. Well, when l get out of here, how about l take you and my new liver out for a night on the town? What do you say? Uh, Mr. Mackie, no offense or anything. You're very handsome, but, l, um, l'm not l mean, you're not my type because You're a man, and [chuckling] George, l never thought you were gay. - You didn't? - Oh, child, please. You? Gay? l'm sick, George, not blind. But then, why have? Because dying is a ''get out of jail free'' card. l can be as bold as l want, and there's nothing anybody can say about it. So l flirt. Haven't you been attracted to someone you know you couldn't have? Well l'm No. What's her name? There's no l'm not [laughing] You know This is really not Meredith. Hmm. Meredith. [inhaling] To be young and in love. Let's go get that liver, shall we? No, l'm sorry, l l didn't [sighing] l never liked harvesting. Why? Like l said, l'm a surgeon. l save lives. This ends one. l know you tried, so no hard feelings, OK. - l was just - You were saying goodbye. What's Viper doing here? Probably crashed his bike. Again. How long has he been waiting? l don't know. l've been busy on real cases. He's all yours. Viper. Viper? Are you OK? [coughing] Viper! - [Meredith] Oh! - [gasping] Call the OR, tell them we're coming, and page Dr. Bailey. Alex, let's go. Alex, push the damn gurney! - [nurse] Clear the way. Coming through. - Somebody get the elevator. l don't know how long l can keep this wound closed. Move faster. Damn it! [elevator bell dings] This a new one? Somebody get her off my patient. Meredith, get cleaned up and scrub in. Alex, back downstairs. Yeah, but l helped. They tell me down in the pit, you only wanna take the hot cases. Every pack of interns, there's always one fool running around trying to show off. And, Alex, this time that fool is you. Get out. Get me something to stand on. Lower this table. The mountain is gonna have to come to me. Count backwards from ten for me. Richard. You're a good friend. The best. Shut up and count backwards already, Mack. Ten Nine Eight Seven [beeping] l'm not gonna stay. lt's your job. You have to. You're better at this part than me. l don't wanna watch him get taken apart. Look at the vultures waiting to pick him clean. Every last one of them represents someone somewhere who's gonna live because of Kevin. [Cristina] Here. Put it on. l'll be waiting next door when you're ready. Everyone's waiting. OK, doctors, let's get this over with. [? Reindeer Section: You Are My Joy] [monitor beeping] [flatlining] [door opening] lzzie? l'm gonna sew him up, for his family. You do it. - What? - You do it. Mrs. Davidson. He's ready, if you'd like to see him. [sighs] [laughing] [Bailey] This lovely group's his friends. Uh, you all belong to What's his name? - Viper. - V Viper. [man] Yeah, we were in the race. How is he? ls he OK? ls he OK? No. No, he's not OK at all. He hurled his body down a concrete mountain at full speed for no good reason. [scoffing] Yeah, l know you all pierce yourselves, smoke up and generally treat your bodies like your grungy asses can't break down. That's fine. You want to kill yourselves flying down a concrete mountain, go to it. But there are other people walking, people driving, people trying to live their lives on that concrete mountain. One of them got his brains scrambled 'cause one of you little sniveling no-good snot rags - Dr. Bailey. - Yeah, so. OK, no. Your friend, Viper, as far as l'm concerned, is not OK. [man exhaling] She's, um really tired. [Meredith] But Viper's gonna make it. He's gonna live. - [man 1] Cool. Thanks. - [man 2] Thanks. [? Lisa Loeb: Fools Like Me] lt's not the chase. - What? - You and me. lt is not the thrill of the chase. lt's not a game. [sighing] lt's lt's your tiny, ineffectual fists. And your hair. - My hair? - lt smells good. And you're very, very bossy. Keeps me in line. l'm still not going out with you. You say that now. - [monitor beeping] - How'd it go? Very smoothly. Damn. That means l'm gonna have to quit smoking. Ah, the pretty ones always come crawling back. [Meredith] There's another way to survive this competition. A way no one ever seems to tell you about. One you have to learn for yourself. Number five: It's not about the race. At all. There are no winners or losers. Victories are counted by the number of lives saved. [Cristina] Oh, OK. This is the best part. Watch. She pulls the flap of skin down over the face. - We were - Hi. We were we were just, uh Cristina made us. [Meredith] And, once in a while, if you're smart, the life you save could be your own. What are we watching? Ooh. This is the one where my mother - Literally pulls this guy's face off. - Yeah. - Oh, come on! - Holy crap!

                    			[? The Eames Era: Could be Anything] [Meredith] Intimacy is a four-syllable word for, ''Here are my heart and soul. Please grind them into hamburger and enjoy. '' It's both desired and feared, difficult to live with Uh, excuse me! Excuse me! and impossible to live without. ls that my toothbrush?! [Meredith] Intimacy also comes attached to life's three R's: Relatives, romance and roommates. Coffee? [Meredith] There are some things you can't escape. And other things you just don't want to know. Hello, kitty. [siren wailing] You don't understand. Me gonads, you ovaries. That reminds me. We are out of tampons. You're parading in your underwear when l'm naked in the shower. Can you add it to your list? - What?! - Tampons! To the list. lt's your turn. l am a man! l don't buy girl products! l don't want you walking in while l'm in the shower, and l don't want to see you in your underwear. lt doesn't bother me, OK? Look at me in my underwear, George. Take your time. lt's no big deal. [car alarm activating] You are the first person they see in the morning. You say please. You say thank you. You apologize for waking them up. You make them feel good about you. Why is that important? 'Cause then they'll talk to you and tell you what's wrong. Why is that important? Because then you can tell your attending what they need to know during rounds. And why is that important? Because if you make your resident look bad, she'll torture you until you beg for your mama. Now get out there. l want pre-rounds done by 5:30am. - Morning, Dr. Model. - Dr. Evil Spawn. Ooh, nice tat. They airbrush that out for the catalogs? l don't know. What do they do for the 666 on your skull? l'd better get good patients today. Yesterday l had two guys with colostomies who needed dressing changes every 1 5 minutes. l'm gonna be in surgery. Today's my day. - On what? - Like l'd tell you. What do you know? l know l was here at 4:00, and you didn't get here till 4:30. Tell me. No. l'm not the intern who's screwing an attending. l am not screw You're here early. l have chordotomy at 5:00. l'm out at 6:00. l might buy you breakfast before rounds. - l've already eaten. - What'd you have? - None of your business. - You a cereal person? Straight out of the box? Or all fruit and fiber-y? [laughing] Pancakes? Do you like pancakes. Fine, leftover grilled cheese. Curiosity satisfied? That's sad. lt's pathetic. A good day starts with a good breakfast. Look, l'm not being seen with you in this hospital. Learn it, live it. lt's unprofessional. An attending getting to know one of his interns. - He slept with the intern. - Barely knew her. You want me to be professional? l'll be professional. - That's what l want. - That's what you get. You're gonna be late for your chordotomy. Nice talking to you, Dr. Grey. [woman talking over PA] Anyone seen the floor chart on the new admission? [door banging] You always come in like that, bang the light on? - You're Elizabeth Fallon? - What does my chart say? lt says you used to be a nurse here. - A scrub nurse. - And you have abdominal mass consistent with pancreatic cancer. Oh, and you are hoping they're gonna give me a Whipple. Pancreatic duodectomy. This hospital sees those one Maybe once every six months. That's why you got here at 4:30, huh? Grabbed my chart before anybody else could see it. lmpress Dr. Burke with your pre-round exam so you'd be the logical intern for him to ask to scrub in. Ha-ha! l know all the tricks, doctor. Yang. Cristina Yang. l'll call you Cristina. You call me Nurse Fallon. Mr. Humphrey? Mr. Humphrey, l'm sorry to wake you. Come on. What time is it? Ten after 5:00. l'm sorry. l just need to do a brief exam. lf you could sit up for one moment. Thanks. This might be a little bit cold, so just take a deep breath. lf you could just take a deep breath. You're not a doctor. l'm Dr. Stevens. You can call me lzzie. l'll be helping Dr. Bailey with your biopsy. No, l don't think so, no. Mr. Humphrey, this will just take a moment. No, get me Dr. Bailey or Dr. Victor. - l just need to do a brief - You don't need to do anything. ls this you? Huh? ls this you? lt is, isn't it? You know, get out of my room. - Mr. Humphrey - Get out of my room. [George] There need to be some rules. So, what, we can walk around in our underwear on alternate Tuesdays, or you could see bras but not panties? Or are you talking Amish rules? lf you think you're gonna get lzzie to cover herself The amount of flesh exposed is not the point. You have to do something. lt's your house. - lt's my mother's house. - Meredith Do you like lzzie? ls that what this is about? - Do you have a crush on lzzie? - lzzie? No. l don't like lzzie. lzzie No. l She's not the one l'm attracted to. Not the one. So there's a one. This is not [stammering] Look, there just have to be some rules. O'Malley, Grey, get Karev and head down to Trauma. Shepherd needs you. - Shepherd's in surgery. - He got pulled before he could start. [elevator bell dinging] [monitor beeping] Those look like Nails. [? Psapp: Nobody Knows] - l can't see my hands. - Oh, my God. He's conscious. Breathe deeply, George. You won't pass out. Use 4 milligrams of morphine. Titrate up to 1 0. You know what? l don't want him to move. - l can't see. - lt's OK. We need you to be still, Mr Cruz, Jorge Cruz. He tripped and fell down a flight of stairs holding a nail gun. Somehow he managed to miss a blood vessel. That's a minor miracle. Optic nerve's been affected. Can you feel this? Numbness on his right side. - What's our immediate concern? - lnfection. l wanna pull these nails out in the next half-hour. - Need a CT. - CTs are down. - What? - Exchanged them last night. Computer's crashed, back up by 1 :00. What are the options? - MRl. - Brilliant. Man's got nails in his head. Let's put him in a giant magnet. You want films from three axis points and a C-arm in surgery. Dig up research and find out if this has ever happened before. My wife. My wife, my wife. You wife is on the way, Mr. Cruz. Stay with him, keep him calm and look for changes. Ohh. l can't see. Fifty-five-year-old woman with adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. Has had radiation therapy to reduce the tumor load. Rates her abdominal pain three out of ten. Positive nausea, but no vomiting. Diarrhea, hematochezia, melena, afebrile with T-max 37-2 and stable vital signs. Lab significant for a total ability of seven and elevated liver enzymes. Thank you, Dr. Yang. Aggressive little witch, isn't she? She stole my chart during pre-rounds so she could scrub in on my surgery. She's hoping for a Whipple. Well, actually, Liz, l was gonna give you to Meredith Grey. Ellis's daughter? Yes, she's an intern this year. Thought you'd have something to talk about. Oh, l doubt that. l was Ellis's scrub nurse for 1 8 years, practically lived with that woman. l didn't meet that daughter once. Anyway, Shepherd has her on the guy with the nails in his head. There's a guy with nails in his head? Seven of them. Shot himself in the head with a nail gun. ''Nail'' nails? Sixteen pennies, three and a half inches long. - Still alive? - Fully conscious. Should be a pretty interesting surgery. But l guess you've got the Whipple. l'm gonna need a full blood work-up and abdominal CT. CTs are down this morning. Then an MRl. She needs an enema, an ERCP for a stent and brush biopsy this afternoon. Take care of her. Liz is an institution around here. Good call, doctor. Grey's got the human two-by-four, and you have the institution in need of an enema. You'd say your health's been good recently? Maybe some headaches. Nothing compared to now. Sona, that's my wife. Sona, she'll say, ''Why you think they call it a gun, moron?'' She hates the damn things. With good reason. - Baby? - [Jorge] Sona. You are in so much trouble. Get a history from her before you scrub in. - OK. - Thank you. Twenty-three. People have been accidentally shot in the head with nails 23 times. One was attempted suicide, doesn't count. Oh, so he pointed a nail gun at his head on purpose? That makes me feel better. So, uh Grey and Stevens really walk around in their underwear? Not all the time. l mean, some of the time, you know. But not all the time. Sexy underwear? Yeah. l mean [Alex] And they just, uh, let you look at them? Well, uh yeah. Like sisters. No, well, not like sisters. [laughing] l don't think of them as sisters. But they're not coming on to you. - Not exactly. - They don't expect you to do anything. No. But Like sisters. Just like sisters. ls he prepped? l think they're doing it right now. You think? He's having a prostate biopsy. Trust me. lf you'd been in there, you'd know. OK, Mr. Humphrey. We're gonna get started. Get her out of here. l want her out of here! Just get her out of here! Just you go! Now! Just go now! Hey, relax! Relax, Mr. Humphrey. [Sona] Will he be able to see again? We won't know until the nails come out. Did he tell you he takes photos? Beautiful photos. lt's his hobby. l just got him a new digital camera, and now he can't stop, you know? He always has it out, always taking pictures of me. Jorge said he's been having headaches. Can you tell me about them? Have they been recent? Um l'm not sure. Maybe the last couple of months. Have you seen him experience any dizziness or disorientation? Yes, yes, l have. OK. You want to tell me what that was all about? Nothing. He's probably just crazy or something. Bethany Whisper. - What? - Bethany Whisper. l did a new Bethany Whisper lingerie ad. - He saw it in a magazine. - You got time to pose for magazines? No, the shoot was last year. lt just came out. - So because he saw you in a thong - lt wasn't a thong. you're hiding in the hallway. Might be easier if you assign another intern. Easy is not in your job description. You are a doctor. He is a patient. He's your patient. Biopsy these. lf they come back positive, l expect to see you in surgery. Hey, you're on this. You understand me? - Vertiginous or light-headedness? - Light-headed. Sometimes he'd have to brace himself to get out of bed. Could be a million things. Simple orthostasis. What? What made him fall with a nail gun? He said he tripped. Just because you hear hoofbeats, don't assume zebras. Something caused him to lose consciousness and fall down the stairs. He could have a tumor. Look, l have no idea why this guy's still alive, let alone moving and talking. Not a clue. Let's just get him through this before we start digging around for something else. - Shepherd. Twenty-three cases? - One was attempted suicide. - Doesn't count. Talk about procedure. - Problems: bleeding and infection. Odds improved with shorter surgery. Bottom line was get them out quickly and watch for bleeding. l got it. Other words, l'm on my own. You coming? Dude, l don't need an escort. Go. Go ahead. [receiver clicking] Well, well, well. Dr. Bethany Whisper. That's so nice. [whistling] [humming] She had this thing for red when we met. Red car, red dresses, red hats. Personally, l hated the color. Too obvious, you know? But a couple years ago, l took her up to the mountains. She was in a red dress, and there was this field of red poppies, l think. And she jumped out of the car and ran into them and started laughing laughing at all the red. The good news is it hasn't spread from his prostate to his lymph nodes. With a radical prostatectomy, we could probably get it all. - Good prognosis. - Spare some nerves? Give him a chance at a normal sex life? Young puppies like to take chances with cancer. Old dogs like me, we do what works. Yes, sir, of course. - We on the schedule tomorrow? - 1 0:00am. Good. Maybe l can squeeze in a round. An ass who deals in asses. We call him ''Limp Harry.'' He never spares the nerves. [Richard] As you can see, the patient has shot seven nails directly into the skull without doing significant damage other than the optic nerve, and we may be able to save that. The idea is to remove the nails at exactly the angle they entered. Any wiggle, and we risk doing more damage than when they went in. Where are they? Move over. They're just pulling them out. Hey, l heard you got a Whipple. A maybe Whipple. Burke is running my butt off. Oh, man. Look at those films! [laughing] lt's Hellraiser. [woman] Maybe try to an 87. [man] Small increase, then it will stabilize. - Gelfoam. - Here you go. There goes the third grade. [Burke] Dr. Yang did you put in the blood work? Oh, right before l got here. Hmm. Take her to Radiology for the MRl. Beep me when you're done. [sighing] You want the Whipple, right? Yeah. [door opening] - Hey. - Hey. Here. My share of the grocery money. - When are you going? - Tonight. Seriously, George. Please don't Yeah, could we not talk about it here? What, tampons? Did you not hear a word l said? You're a man. We know. Talk about shrinking the salamander. l always divided surgeons into two categories: Those that remember the names of their patients and those who didn't. They all remember their surgeries, of course. Every damn suture. But the good ones remember the names, right? l didn't say that. Now, some of the best ones, you know, distance themselves on purpose. They believe that the personal stuff clouds the medicine. - Hi, Liz. - Hey. But? l'm waiting for the ''but.'' l'm sure there's a big, fat qualifier coming. - Hey, Liz. - Hey! Looking good. Oh, you liar. How you doing, honey? Oh, fabulous. Just fabulous. - Hey, Liz. - [Liz] Hey. Hey, Liz. - Bleeding? - lt's clean. All right. Way to go, team. Good job, everybody. Thank you. [Derek] l don't think we made it worse. The big question is the optic nerve. We'll know in the morning. Should l order the MRl? He needs to stabilize. We'll do it tomorrow. [man] One of the most amazing things l ever saw. ls it over? Hey, is it over? Yeah, it's over. Hey, does Burke have a Whipple scheduled? [Cristina] l wanted to know if you've seen Fallon's labs. - l have. - They're getting worse. The stent doesn't seem to be helping her jaundice. [Burke] No. - Should we be doing something? - We are. You didn't have the Whipple on the board. Want me to schedule it for you? l want to see the results of her biopsy, and have a look at her overnight labs. - Overnight? - You're on-call, right? Um Sure, yeah. Well, good. Stick with her. You're doing the surgery, right? Y-you're still doing the Whipple? The woman has pancreatic cancer, Dr. Yang. We're gonna do something. OK. OK. - [Liz] Kiss the baby for me. - [woman] Get some sleep, Liz. OK. Good night. [woman] See you later, hon. [man] Bye-bye, Liz. Bye-bye. Take care. [woman 1] l'll catch up with you guys later. [woman 2] l'm gonna check later. Oh. Your mom's a bigger woman. You were her scrub nurse. Liz Fallon. Come in. Meredith Grey. She wanted me to send her regards. That doesn't sound like her. Excuse me? Well, the Ellis Grey l know didn't have regards for anyone except Ellis Grey. But you know that already, don't you? Where is she now? Traveling. - Traveling? - Yeah. Huh. ls she practicing? Not so much. Oh. Doesn't sound like her, either. She was all work, just like me. She never left the hospital. But you know that, too, don't you? ls she well? She's fine. Good. Just wanted to send her regards. - Take care. - Yeah. [Meredith] l think these were taken at the old house. There's you in your scrubs. Who is that? That's Dad. Who? Your husband. Thatcher Grey. You called him Thatch. Thatch. That's the red wagon he got me for my birthday. l'm about four years old in this photo. This is your family. Sure, sure. l saw Liz Fallon at the hospital today. [laughing] Liz. l love her. How is she? ls she still a scrub nurse? She was excellent. [? Get Set Go: Break Your Heart] [lzzie] l reminded you before you went. l forgot when l got there. No, no. You were so passive-aggressive. Naked. l am naked in the shower. They're just tampons, George. l really needed tampons. God! l'm not riding in the same car with him. Unless you're going like that, you're not riding with me. - Where are the tampons? - He didn't buy them. [Meredith] You didn't buy them? Men don't buy tampons. You are gonna have to get over the man thing, George. We're women! We have vaginas! Get used to it. l am not your sister! [clearing throat] Grilled cheese again? Cold pizza. - ls he awake? - Even better. Really? Let's see what his nurse says. Hi, Sona, Jorge. How are you this morning? Tell them what color my dress is, Jorge. l'd know the answer to that even if l couldn't see. We can go over there and check it out lt's not a problem at all. [man] Let's do it. Uh-huh. l'm taking the elevator. Take the stairs. l was going to, anyway. Good. Hold it. Thank you. [laughter] What? You don't wake a patient like that. What do l have to do to get through to you? Cut me some slack. l was on call last night. l didn't get much sleep. Oh, stop whining. You'd rather be here, and you know it. What you got waiting for you at home? Boyfriend? No. A girlfriend? No. A pet? Family? A bed. We got plenty of beds here. l don't feel sorry for you. [Liz] This is who we are. This is our lives. You tell her, Dr. Burke. Can l talk to you? Hey, come on, come on, come on! - Let's go. - What's going on? Excuse me. What's going on? George, stop. - [cheering] - [whistling] Oh, my God. Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh! We have Bethany Whisper in our locker room. Oh, boy, l guess they do airbrush out the tattoo, don't they? You want to see it? You really want to see it? Fine. Let's look at that tattoo up close and personal, shall we?! And what are these? Oh, my God! Breasts! How does anybody practice medicine hauling these things around?! And what do we got back here? Let's see if l remember my anatomy. Glutes, right? Let's study them, shall we? Gather around and check out the booty that put lzzie Stevens through med school. Have you had enough or should l continue? Because l have a few more very interesting tattoos. You want to call me Dr. Model? That's fine. Just remember that while you're sitting on 200 grand of student loans l'm out of debt. - l'll take them down. - Don't bother. Go! [? Vaughan Penn: Truth] Can you tell me what you had for breakfast on Monday? Cheese omelet. And on Sunday. And on Saturday. And on Friday. Sona gets up every morning and makes me a cheese omelet. lt's the only thing he likes. lt's the only thing you know how to cook. OK, well, things look good. But l need Jorge to get an MRl this morning to check for residual bleeding. OK? This is who l was. lt has nothing to do with who l am now. l'm a physician, a surgeon. And l am just as qualified as any other intern on this floor. So, you're just gonna have to get over your chauvinist crap and allow me to do my job. l'm sure you're a very good doctor. Then what is your problem? Look l fantasized about you about the woman in this photo, whoever she is. l'm not proud of it, but it's a fact. Do you know what they're gonna do to me today? l have cancer. And they're gonna lift up my legs and expose me to the world and cut out my prostate and my nerves, effectively neuter me. So, is it so hard to understand that l don't want the woman who's in that photo to witness my emasculation? - Have you seen her overnight labs? - l have. - Did you check her liver panel? - They're not good. No, they suck. She's choking on bile. - She's jaundiced. - A very sick woman. Why haven't you scheduled the Whipple? Well, are you a surgeon now? l'm her cruise director, pushing her around all day. The woman is circling the drain. We need to do something. l'll take a look at her biopsy. Screw the biopsy. - Dr. Yang - Enough. You know l l You know what l think? l think you never intended to do the Whipple. l think this entire thing has been bull, and you're behaving like the only reason she's in this hospital is to die. [Derek] There. That's a tumor. lt's midline near the hypothalamus. - [sighing] - Damn. Best practice, probably to remove the tumor. ''Probably'' because l can't get it all. Ninety-nine percent, but not all of it. Radiation and chemo, you're looking at maybe five to ten good years. Let's do it. You haven't heard the downside. See, the tumor is located in a part of your brain where your memory and your personality resides. And because of the fuzzy edges of this type of tumor, l have to cut out a lot. Jorge, you stand a good chance of losing your memories, - of losing who you are. - [Sona] ls there any other way? The alternative is gamma or cyberknife treatment with focus radiation. lt's less evasive. There's little chance of memory loss or him losing himself, but it would only give Jorge maybe three to five years. Three to five years? [sniffling] [Derek] This is an incredibly difficult decision. lf you have any more questions or you need to talk to me, l'm here, OK? [breathing heavily] Hey. [Meredith] l told my mother about you. She remembers you very well. Of course she would. Ellis Grey never forgot a thing. [chuckling] Mmm. l'm sorry. lt's not really funny. lt's not funny, but What's her diagnosis? Alzheimer's, early onset. And she doesn't want anyone to know. No. She's in a nursing home, and l'm the only person she'll allow to see her. But if l know Ellis Grey, she made the nursing home sign a contract to that effect. You know my mother well. What a bitch. [both laughing] [lzzie] The woman's life was this hospital. lt was her home. lt's a sweet thing for them to do. lt's a waste of a bed, and it's a waste of my time. Who are we talking about? Liz Fallon. They brought her here to die. Wouldn't you want the same thing for you? No, l'd want the doctors to do everything they could. l want them to cut me open until the minute l die. Sometimes doing everything can be worse than nothing. You are eight feet tall. Your boobs are perfect. Your hair is down to there. lf l were you, l would walk around naked all the time. l wouldn't l wouldn't have a job. l wouldn't have skills. l wouldn't even know how to read. l'd just be - naked. - [laughing] lt's makeup. lt's retouching. You get that we hate you, right? [pager beeping] [sighing] Bailey again. Any patient who spanks to his doctor's pictures forfeits his rights. You're seriously not gonna give up the prostatectomy, are you? lzzie? Oh, forget it. You know, sometimes it is actually, you know, painful to be around you. Where the hell have you been? When l page, you answer. lt's not that difficult to understand. O'Malley answered his page. He's doing your prep. [woman on PA] Dr. Hammond to OR Room 3. Dr. Hammond to OR. Room 3. lf l hear the words Bethany Whisper one more time l can't, OK? l just can't. He doesn't want me in there. No, what he wants is to not have cancer. What he wants is to be saved. You want to stay in the scrub room, that's your choice. All right. l'll do my best. [sighing] Jorge and Sona want the surgery. They want you to cut it out? Mm-hmm. lt's their decision. [machine beeping] [breathing heavily] They were never gonna operate. You could have told me. [Liz] What fun would that have been? Think of it as a hazing ritual. Welcome Liz, don't talk. Don't talk. [raspy breathing] Liz, just [machine beeping rapidly] Liz? Liz, stay Liz, stay with me. Stay with me, Liz. [beeping continues] [alarm beeping] [? Sia: Sunday] Sona? Let's go. - Right right down. - Here we go. Bag her. - Push epi and atropine. - You got it. Somebody page Burke. - [man] l'll start ventilation. - Start that line. - She's DNR. - One, two She's DNR. Do not resuscitate! Dr. Yang! Come on, people! Push another epi! Come on! You need to consider what you'll lose. What good is five years if he doesn't joke about your omelets and he can't remember seeing you in that red dress? lt's still five more years. You don't understand. He'll be there, but he won't be Jorge. - He won't even recognize you. - This is our business. You have no idea what this will do to you. lsn't five good years better than ten bad ones? What the hell are you doing? - She needs to understand. - l do understand. You think that l'm being selfish, that l don't want to give him up. - l don't. - This is Jorge's decision. And if that means ten bad years for me, fine. l'll give him those years because l will give him whatever he wants. Look, l am so sorry, Sona. Just please forgive her. [Sona] And if he doesn't remember me, if he doesn't remember what we are, he's still my Jorge. And l'll remember for us both. OK, all right. - Five, breathe, one, two. - What the hell are you two doing? - We lost pulse. - Let her go. - Where's that epi? - Let her go! She's DNR. Let her go down. Four, five. One, two Do not resuscitate. - lt is on her chart. - All right! Let her go down. Let her go down. [machine flatlining] [woman] Call the lab again. Where are they? He's resecting the prostate, coming up on the distal nerve. You said, ''l am not your sister.'' Do you feel like l was emasculating you? No. [sighing] No. l'm too masculine to be emasculated. [chuckling] l'm sorry. Guess you put Dr. Model to rest. l guess l did. Dr. Victor, l'm sorry. But these are viable nerves. We should save them. lt'll take at least an hour longer, and we might not get it all. [lzzie] You know, they call him Limp Harry. [Bailey] But his prognosis with chemo is nearly as good. Frankly, if you're worried about missing your tee time, l'd be more than happy to finish. Dr. Stevens. [Victor] Can we help you? l'm sorry, Dr. Bailey. Dr. Victor, l agree with her. You just can't You have to save the nerves. - What? - The nerves, you have to save them. Dr. Stevens, l can handle this. Most important is giving the patient what they want. - What Humphrey wants is his erection. - She's yours. You get her out. Can't do that, sir. You know how these young puppies are. l'm going to tell Richard about both of you. You do that. ln the meantime, let's pretend it's you on this table and give this a try. [? Tegan and Sara: Where Does the Good Go?] Dr. Pinosky. You ever called one? No. Call it, doctor. Time of death, 1 1 :43. [Meredith] I wish there were a rule book for intimacy. Some kind of a guide that could tell you when you've crossed the line. You can't lose it like that. [Meredith] It would be nice if you could see it coming. l'll get her. - [sighing] - Let her go. [Meredith] And I don't know how you fit it on a map. We have to let her go. Of course, now you know every time he gets a rise, he'll be thinking of you. [Meredith] You take it where you can get it and keep it as long as you can. [Meredith] And as for rules Better not be using my toothbrush. l'm not. Maybe there are none. Maybe the rules of intimacy are something you have to define for yourself.

                    			[? The Ditty Bops: Wake Up] [Meredith] Remember when you were a kid, and your biggest worry was, like, if you'd get a bike for your birthday or if you'd get to eat cookies for breakfast? Being an adult, totally overrated. I mean, seriously, don't be fooled by all the hot shoes and the great sex and the no parents anywhere telling you what to do. Adulthood is responsibility. The lawyer has been managing her estate with a limited power of attorney, but your mother's Alzheimer's is advancing. So while she's still lucid enough to consent, she needs to sign everything over to you. Me? [Meredith] Responsibility, it really does suck. Look, l haven't slept in 48 hours. l'm getting my first shot at heart surgery this morning. l'm missing rounds. Are you sure there isn't anybody here, or the attorney? l mean, do l really have to be the one to handle this? We're talking about her estate, finances, medical care. You want to leave her life in someone else's hands? She's your mother. [Meredith] Really, really sucks. Adults have to be places and do things and earn a living and pay the rent. And if you're training to be a surgeon, holding a human heart in your hands Hello! Talk about responsibility! - What was that, Dr. Grey? - Sorry, it slipped. My hands lt's OK. l'm done. You can release Mrs. Patterson's heart now, very gently. All right. Let's warm her up. Get her off bypass. Kind of makes bikes and cookies look really, really good, doesn't it? l wish l could hold a heart. A monkey could hold a heart. You're mad Burke didn't ask you. George, l need more ice and chips. - Who else did you invite? - We said the list was jocks only: Surgery, Trauma, Plastics. - Who else? - Some people from Peds. You invited the preschoolers to Meredith's house. Next thing, you'll say that you invited the shrinks. She invited Mental Defects. This party is DOA. Meredith thinks this is a small meet-your-boyfriend cocktail thing. - Did you clear this with her? - No, but l will. l promise. Why are you wasting the only weekend your boyfriend is in town on a big party? ls he bad in bed? No. l just want him to meet some of my friends. Right. Sixty geeks in scrubs are your friends. [pager beeping] Ugh! Bad sex, sucks for you. - l heard there's a party tonight. - Really? A party? - Uh, news to me. - No party. We losing her or what? - Are the grafts? - They're open. Temperature? She's at 96 and rising. [Burke] She should be doing this on her own. [flatlining] [man] That's her falling. Continue the progressions. [Burke] Come on, Mrs. Patterson. Paddles. - [man] Sets are below 90. - [woman] Charge. Ten joules. Clear. [flatline continuing] Come on, Mrs. Patterson. - Give me 20. - Charge. [man] There. We have rhythm. [monitor beeping] [Burke] Reluctant heart. All right. Let's close. Keep an eye on her. Good work, everyone. [Meredith] The scariest part about responsibility? When you screw up and let it slip right through your fingers. Hey, l heard you did a CABG with Burke. - Did you get to hold the heart? - Yeah. lt's an amazing feeling. You never forget the first time. lt was pretty great just to watch. - Vicarious thrills, you know? - Yeah. [elevator bell dinging] [woman over PA] Dr. Bailey to OR 7. Dr. Bailey to OR 7. - See you later. - Bye. [elevator bell dinging] l think maybe l did something to the heart when l was holding it. l nodded off a little, squeezed it. Oh, please. The heart's a tough muscle. lt can take a squeeze or two. My fingernail popped a glove, cut straight through. George, what if l punctured Mrs. Patterson's heart? lf you had punctured it, you would have known when they reperfused. They got her heart beating. The woman's OK. - So l shouldn't tell Burke? - Tell him what? You know, um nothing happened. The woman's OK, right? She's OK. She's fine. She's fine. [? Psapp: Nobody Knows] [Bailey] What do you see, George? [George] Hyperinflated lungs, cloudy with bullae. Seriously diminished capacity. She must be having trouble breathing. Course of action? Bullectomy procedure. Remove the bullae. Reduce pressure. lt says here we operated on her back in '99. So Mrs. Drake has been through this before, but talk her through it anyway. And resist the anti-smoking lectures. She feels bad enough already. So, do you think, if they put a picture of these in a pack of cigarettes, people would stop smoking? How long has your back been hurting you? lt's chronic. Means l have it all the time. l know what ''chronic'' means. What pain are you having? Oh, man, the pain's bad. lt's like a thousand samurai warriors stabbing their swords into my spine. l'm allergic to aspirin, most NSAlDs. So maybe we'll start you on morphine. No. The only things that will work are Demerol or Dilaudid. A ten of Dilaudid will set me straight. The standard starting dose is two. Did you see that Tom Cruise samurai movie, hmm? Pow! Pow! Pow! Exaggerated and overly specific description of his pain. A self-prescription. ''Pow! Pow! Pow!''? - He's a Dilaudid junkie. - What do you do? Check the database for history, refer to a program and discharge. After you give him something. That's exactly what he wants. You still have to treat his pain as if it were real. - [pager beeping] - Why? The first rule in pain management: Always err on the side of caution. He's in our care. He says he's in pain. Start a central line. His veins are shot. The surgery before was supposed to help. But it never felt right. Probably would have been a good idea to quit smoking. l did! Four-pack-a-day habit. lt was hell. - Here you go, Mrs. Drake. - Didn't do any good. Really? Because it looked l mean, from the damage, we all thought you probably were still smoking. Cold turkey, five years ago, and what did l get for my trouble? l still had to quit my job at the restaurant. But even sitting, it hurt. [nurse] Here you go. Nobody believed me. They all said it was in my head. l've seen the films. lt's not all in your head. You're right about that. Hey, come here. You're too damn young to be a doctor. - Hey. - What? l'm older than l look. [chuckling] Do you think this is going to work this time? l think it's your best option. - Straight shooter, huh? - Yes, ma'am. l like that. Hi, Mr. Patterson. Hi. Hemodynamics stable? Yeah, map has stayed around 80. Cardiac output at five. - That's good, Dr. Grey? - That's fine, Mr. Patterson. But it's not good. Well, heart surgery takes a lot out of the patient, but we're monitoring your wife very carefully, and she should be fine. Mr. Sterman, let's see about getting you out of here today. How are you feeling? Pretty OK, except l don't think l ever want to have a bowel obstruction again. Really? We get people in here all the time requesting them. Oh. So, you keeping down clear fluids? And my all-time favorite question: have you pooped yet? l'm not exactly sure. l think you'd probably know. Passed gas? Yes. Really? Because if l bring in my handy lie detector OK, no. And l shouldn't try and lie, l know. l went to medical school. You went to med school? Yeah, dropped out my last year at clinical. Too many hours, and l was staring into the ice-cold eyes of divorce. Wow. Yeah, l do research now, and l have a life, a family. No offense. No, no, that's OK. l'm just one of those people who believe you can have both. Maybe so. But your first responsibility's always gonna be your patient. [woman over PA] Dr. Shepherd to the ER, stat. Dr. Shepherd to the ER, stat. [? Psapp: Tiger, My Friend] Just coffee. Good. - OK. - OK. [Bailey] We call this ''a spaghetti procedure.'' We cut and deflate the bullae to facilitate gentle manipulation of Mrs. Drake's lung. Dr. Bailey, do you see that? Sir? Oh, my ever-lovin' We need to open her up. l'm taking out the scope. You heard him, people. Let's move. - Lights. - Let's get set up. - Ten blade. - Here you go. Retractors. Retractors. Scalpel ready. Towel. Rib spreader. Suction. ls that a towel? - Get a pan. - [George] Where did that come from? Best guess, her surgery five years ago. Something careless this way comes. - A towel? - Not good. She complained of pressure on her chest. Nobody took her seriously. Not good for the patient, not good for the hospital. - Not good. - Cristina, hit the files. Find out everything you can about that initial operation. Who was in that room? Who was responsible for closing? George, stay with the patient. Keep her happy. She seems to like you. Right, OK, um, how long do you think? l mean, just technically, l'm off at 6:00. - Am l invited? - Excuse me? Am l invited to the party? Oh. Well, yeah. Yes, yeah, of course. What was l supposed to say? Ugh! OK, yeah, great. All right, 1 4 cases. [pager beeping] What kind? l don't know. Maybe an assortment. Microbrews, locals. Make sure they throw in some bar nuts. l'm ordering office supplies. Oh, yeah, sure. Microbrews, local. And throw in some bar nuts. Hey, any luck? Hey, if l do, will you invite me to the party? [laughing] [yelling] Yeah, great. OK, thanks. Take it easy. - Hey, Mr. Frost. - Where have you been?! We're going to take care of you, all right? - Where the hell have you been?! - How's that? When l tell you to start a central line, you start a central line, no judgment, no question. The guy's been in 7 hospitals in the last 4 months. He's an addict. The patient has a three-lumbar fusion. He's a junkie. We shouldn't be giving him Yeah, he's an addict, but his pain is real. Lose the attitude, get down there, start a central line. [monitor beeping] Told me l had a towel inside me. Who told you that? A surgeon, an older man. Handsome. That's Dr. Webber. - He's our chief. - Yeah. lt was a towel that somebody left the last time. Yes, ma'am. Who would do that? That doesn't seem right, does it? No, ma'am, no. lt doesn't. l was walking around with a towel inside of me. How could that happen? So? What happens now? Now you keep this to yourself while we work it out. Do this for me. [man over PA] Dr. Stevens, call CCU. Dr. Stevens, call CCU. [elevator bell dinging] [telephone ringing] - You OK? - Yeah, yeah, l'm good. Are you sure? Because you seem not OK. l'm fine. CABG was long. Well, let me take you out to dinner tonight. You can tell me all about it. Real food, waiters, big chunks of carbs in a basket. - l can't. - Forget the party. - You know about the party? - You and l can be alone somewhere else. - How do you know about the party? - Thanks for not inviting me. Dinner, think about dinner. Perfect opportunity. Well [pager beeping] Ugh! Started having swelling over her sternum, then blood started gushing. Dr. Burke is on his way. ls she dying? Somebody get him out of here. - Keep applying pressure. - Tyler, call for an OR. - What happened? She got her protamine? - Per protocol. No allergic, anaphylactic or histamine responses. Her last counts? BT, PTT, lNR, platelet counts were all stable. Even her HNH were stable. What the hell went wrong? Let's move. Hold on. - l popped a glove. - What? ln surgery, when l was holding it, l popped a glove with my fingernail. l think l may have nicked her heart. Let's go, people. What were you thinking about? You had every opportunity to speak up before l closed her chest. - Suction. - l'm sorry. And then you confess in front of her husband? You don't even know if you were the cause. You have no idea. - l'm sorry. - Sponge. There. Over here. There. Look at the wall rupture. lt's a hell of a lot more than a fingernail. Her ventricular walls are weak. l just had a conversation with Mr. Patterson. l want copies of his wife's chart in my office by 5:00. Tomorrow, the two of you meet with me and Legal, and you better damn well be able to explain what happened here. People poking holes in hearts and leaving towels. You're gonna go back and talk to the husband. Review the history. Apologize profusely. Your ass is on the line here, Dr. Grey. You got called before the chief? Tomorrow morning. l could get kicked out of the program. - l could, right? - You're not getting kicked out. Patterson's just gonna sue. Patterson is not going to sue. You're not getting kicked out. What were you thinking? Telling Burke? - l told her not to. - [cellphone ringing] l got to take this. Thanks. Thank you. Very comforting. l'll watch your books. Oh. OK, so the beer is coming at 7:00, and some of the floor nurses are bringing wine. - You invited nurses? - Did you clear this with Meredith? A few more people isn't gonna make a difference. A party is a party. And the bigger the party, the less time for bad sex. - Would you stop saying that. - OK. Hank and l have great sex, all the time. We'll probably have sex after the party, or during the party. As long as you clear it with Meredith. Hank just needs to realize that doctors can have fun. We're not all workaholics with God complexes. We are workaholics with God complexes. And the notary can be there at 6:30 too? And the home's physician will be there to attest to her mental competency? OK. ls there anything else l need to bring beside my license? My checkbook. l heard. lt's a notary thing, a thing to get notarized. l'm talking about the heart thing. Do you want to talk about it? We're adults. When did that happen? And how do we make it stop? Dr. Yang. Dr. Burke. That bypass graft got a little complicated. lt's nothing l couldn't handle. Good. Uh-huh. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Listen, l'll call you back. [cellphone beeping] That was my lawyer. He's advising me not to talk to you. Mr. Patterson, l know that you're frustrated and angry, but l need We need some more information about your wife. The walls of her heart are abnormally thin. Hey, don't blame this on my wife. l heard from your very mouth what happened. l know. But we can't treat her. No, she was in the best shape of her life. You ask her cardiologist. She had lost 1 00 pounds. Don't you dare try to hang this on her. Mr. Patterson, please. We're through talking. [sighing] You don't like me very much, do you? Oh, Jerry, it's not you specifically. lt's just lt's just people like you, that's all. Doc, l'm feeling pretty good. Pain's about a three. A three? That's excellent. Mr. Frost, l'm glad we could help you out, as well as County, Mercy West, Seattle Pres. A lot of people have helped you out lately, Jerry. We're pleased we could do our part. Who's on discharge today, Dr. Karev? [Alex] Stevens. Dr. Stevens is gonna discharge you. Whoa, you can't discharge me. l'm in pain. You were in pain. Now you're not. Dr. Karev is going to recommend some wonderful treatment programs for you. Go home. Get some help. You can't just do that! He just did, my friend. OK, any luck yet? Nada. Ugh. Looks like you're gonna have to spend another night. l hate to miss the party. You gonna make it? You are the last person on my list, so it's looking pretty good. So, doctors have lives after all. Who'd have thunk? Dr. Stevens, discharge my guy in 342. Don't look at me like that. lt's not gonna take very long. lt's not. - You page me? - l'm gonna be a while. Do you think you could get home to sign for the beer? Why don't you have your boyfriend sign for it? You have a very annoying way of sneaking up on people. Maybe if you were a little less creepy l wouldn't come. l hate big parties. ls Meredith the only person who doesn't know the size of this thing? l'm telling her. - You can't. She's gone already. - What, already? l think she had um, excuse me an errand to run. You don't think Meredith's going to mind, right? l want you to make it very clear to her that l had nothing to do with this party nothing. Oh, l'm sorry l'm late. lt was the traffic. lt doesn't matter, dear. Don't tell me the notary didn't show. Oh, everybody's here. lt's just your mother isn't. Mom? Mom? What do you people want from me? We need you to sign the lawyer's papers. l have a cranial reconstruction in a half an hour. l need to go. OK, Mom. We're all here. We have a notary. l need you to focus, and l need you to sign these papers. Mom, look at me. lt's an emergency surgery. l don't have time for this. She can't sign anything now. We should have done this earlier in the day. l couldn't come earlier in the day. l have a job and a life, and l'm here now. You're gonna have to come back tomorrow, when she's lucid. You know, why did she put this off for so long? And why did you let her? Doesn't it strike you as irresponsible? l mean, what the hell is wrong with you people?! [woman] Dr. Lewis to Peds ICU. Dr. Lewis to Peds ICU. [clearing throat] [low dialogue] [dance music playing] lzzie, l'm gonna kill you. You could touch that, but l'd have to kill you. - So, about that towel thing? - lt's been taken care of. OK. You don't need to concern yourself with it. So, what's gonna happen? We're not gonna talk about it anymore is what's gonna happen, we clear? Or you had too much alcohol to understand me? - We're very clear. - Good. You have any bourbon? You can't discharge a man in pain. Ow! You're hurting me! You're the one who's making it difficult. Stop resisting. Just give me the hit of Demerol. The Dilaudid hasn't worn off yet. Look, l'm not leaving. - l'm calling Psych. - No, no. - Don't call Psych. - Wait, wait, wait. Stop, Jerry. Stop. Stop. [gasping] Jerry. Jerry! Concussion? He's blown his left pupil. Page Shepherd. We got to get him to CT. That was one hard fall. What do you see? [lzzie] Subdural bleed. With midline shift. We have to evacuate this now. Anywhere else you have to be, Dr. Stevens, or are you in? - Brain surgery? - Mm-hmm. - Are you kidding me? - That's what l thought. [? lnterpol: Evil] Here you go. Where is lzzie?! She didn't clear it with you? This was supposed to be a meet-the-boyfriend get-together little thing! lzzie has a lot of friends. lzzie doesn't know this many people. l told her to clear it with you. l can't handle this. You want me to kick everyone out? l'm going to kick everyone out. Baby, you made it! Whoo! [laughing] Screw it. Hold this. And give me this. [glass breaking] l made it! George! George, come here. Come on. - See it? - lt's hard to miss. - More than he bargained for. - [Alex] Maybe he's lucky. Maybe this is his way out of the hole. The hole? lnteresting expression. My father was into smack pretty heavy. He was a musician. lt's tolerated in his line of work. Not good for the family at home. Why do we want to be surgeons, anyway? Surgery is a very serious business. [belching] Full house. [laughing] Royal flush. Get naked, baby boy. - Surgery is stupid. - You're so sexy! lt's stupid. - lt's stupid. - Give me that. You're drunk. l'm not driving. l'm not on-call. l'm in my own house. My life is crap. And it's my party, and l'll get drunk if l want to. ls, um, lzzie Stevens? Oh, you must be Hank. [laughing] He's very large and hockey-like. No, lzzie's not here right now. OK. You and lzzie will give birth to very tall, blonde people kind of like Barbies. lzzie was going to be home. She didn't say there was a party. Which pisses both of us off. Would you like some tequila? When do you think she's gonna get here? Don't know. Look, we're low on ice, Hank. - l'm serious. - So am l. We're interns, Hank. The hospital owns us. lt's what we do. Bye. Nice to meet you. Can you guys see him through recovery? - Yeah, l'll take it. - No, l can do it. That's OK, Stevens. He's my patient now too. No, l got it. See your hockey player. l'm serious. Yeah, OK. l guess. Thanks, Alex. No problem. [sighing] - Hey! - Hey. What are you doing here? Mmm. l'm sorry l didn't have a chance to call. My patient needed brain surgery. Like, we were inside his brain. How cool is that? [laughing] Oh, my God. There's a party at your house. Yeah, did you get a chance to hang out? l wanted you to meet some of the people l work with. l don't care about the people you work with. l just want to see you. You didn't mind meeting the people l worked with when they were models. Yeah, well, when they were models, you actually showed up to your own parties. Yeah. This is my life now, Hank. l work 1 00-hour weeks. l can't always show up to my own parties on time. My patients have to come first. lt's just Yeah, l just flew across the entire country, and there's 1 00 people at your house. what l do all day. l shouldn't have to apologize for that. No, you shouldn't. [? lvy: The Edge of the Ocean] Look, let's just go by the party for a little while. You'll really like everyone once you get a chance to know them. l should just go. Hank, come on. l'll call you. [Derek] You know, in some states, you get arrested for that. So, you blew me off for a bottle of tequila. Tequila's no good for you. Doesn't call, doesn't write. lt's not nearly as much fun to wake up to. Take me for a ride, Derek. You know, it sounds like the party's winding down. - Listen to me! - What? We should probably sneak inside now. We've done enough sneaking for the night. lt was good sneaking, but enough sneaking. Yeah, l'd say we're pretty good sneakers. You mind moving this tail wagon? You're blocking me in. Apparently not good enough. [clearing throat] [sighing] When's your meeting with the chief? ln an hour. Holy mother of destruction. You missed Doctor-palooza. Apparently, you didn't. l should probably never speak to you again. l'm so sorry, Meredith. l had no idea it was going to get so [Meredith] lt's OK. Really, l don't care. What would l be doing, anyway? Preparing for your career-altering meeting. Sorry. That heart wall shouldn't have torn. Anything in the patient's history? Husband said she was in the best shape of her life. She lost 1 00 pounds last year. How's her muscle mass? Do you even know whose that was? l'm hoping it was yours. No. What do you think? [Cristina] 50 says Meredith gets tossed out and Burke walks away clean. Please be nice to her. [sighing] [sighing] So, l have done a lot of research on this, and Dr. Burke has been kind enough to help me. And l understand my responsibility in what l've done wrong here. However, l do think the patient's history is significant in this case. She still weighs 200 pounds, which is why no one even noticed it. But with that kind of a weight drop, it doesn't matter how much you weigh. You're anorexic. Along with all that fat, she was losing heart muscle. That certainly could be the reason for a small poke to become a large tear. That still doesn't change the fact, though. The poke wasn't reported at the time of the occurrence. - And if l could change that - And you can't. You left yourself and the hospital open to tremendous liability. [Burke] Not if the weight loss caused the problem. - l have no choice - l've spoken to the husband. His wife remains stable l can't take your beliefs to the bank, Dr. Burke. Dr. Grey made a huge error here. - And she reported it. - Too late. And in front of the patient's husband. But she reported it. She spoke up. Five years ago, as a CT fellow, l had a nagging feeling that l didn't check the body cavity of a lung patient closely enough before l closed. The patient seemed fine post-op, and l was in a hurry. And yesterday you and Dr. Bailey pulled a towel out from under that patient's lung. Why didn't l report it at an appropriate time? Maybe because l was afraid that l would be called into a meeting where some hospital lawyer's fear of liability could end my career. Even great doctors make mistakes, and when we do, we've got to have a chance to speak up without fear of retribution. Or everyone suffers. Dr. Grey spoke up. [Meredith] Responsibility: it really does suck. Meredith. You OK? - Yeah, one-month probation. - That's good. Yep. Burke saved my ass in there. Don't you all have something better to do? Come on, people, move! He was always gonna tell them about the towel. Just wanted to wait for the right time. lnformation is power. [? The Buffseeds: Sparkle Me] [Meredith] Once you get past the age of braces and training bras, responsibility doesn't go away. Jerry, this is Sloane. She's here to talk to you, if you want, about options for rehab. [Meredith] It can't be avoided. Mrs. Drake, l cannot begin to tell you how truly sorry l am. Either someone makes us face it, or we suffer the consequences. lzzie! l did it! l pooped! All right! - Missed your party? - Life as a surgeon. And loving every minute of it. [Meredith] And still, adulthood has its perks. Thanks for the coffee. [Meredith] I mean, the shoes, the sex, the no parents anywhere telling you what to do that's pretty damn good.

                    			Previously on Grey's Anatomy: - We had sex, once. - Go out with me. You know you're my boss, it's against the rules. Do you like lzzie? ls that what this is about? She's not the one l'm attracted to. So there's a one. Ever been attracted to someone you couldn't have? Meredith. - Just coffee. - Good. - OK. - OK. [woman] Your mother's Alzheimer's is advancing. While she's lucid enough, - she needs to sign everything to you. - Me? Thanks for the coffee. [Derek] So you blew me off for a bottle of tequila. That's not nearly as much fun to wake up to. - [knocking] - Mind moving this tail wagon? You're blocking me in. [sighing] [Meredith] A couple hundred years ago, Benjamin Franklin shared with the world the secret of his success. ''Never leave that till tomorrow, '' he said, ''which you can do today. '' - [? Jem: Save Me] - [thunder rumbling] [alarm buzzing] This is the man who discovered electricity. You'd think more of us would listen to what he had to say. I don't know why we put things off, but if I had to guess, I'd say it has a lot to do with fear. Fear of failure, fear of pain, fear of rejection. Wouldn't it be easier to just ask her out? [thunder rumbling] [alarm buzzing] - She's gonna be late. - Maybe not. - [lzzie gasping] - We should wait for her. Definitely not. l'm not her mother, and you are not her boyfriend. Not yet, anyway. Stop, OK? l told you l'm not interested. Life is short, George. Do you really want to die before you ever ask her out? l do not want to ask her out. Do you really want to die a liar? l'm not l'm not dying. [Meredith] Sometimes, the fear is just of making a decision. Because, what if you're wrong? What if you're making a mistake you can't undo? Crap. Crap? Hi. l'm late. You're avoiding me. Yes, but also late. Oh, are we going to talk about this? No. About us and Bailey and what she saw? l don't need to talk about it. l experienced it, naked. This is getting complicated. Complicated for me. l'm the intern sleeping with the attending. Bailey isn't speaking to me anymore. Not that that's a bad thing. lf l was a better guy, l'd walk away. Yes, you would. Do you want me to be a better guy? Yes. No. Crap. l'm late. Take your time. Think about it. [? Psapp: Chapter] [elevator bell dinging] That was definitely worth being late. [sighs] Thanks. ls this a? Should we talk about this? Yeah, definitely. - [Meredith] You're late. - So are you. l know, and l can't afford to piss off Bailey any more. Do you think she told anyone? - About you and McDreamy? - Yeah. No, he's her boss too. lf they find out, what can they? Can they kick me out, or? No Not officially. You'll just get edged out, blacklisted, banned from his surgeries, passed over for chief resident. [sighing] lt'll be humiliating, but you'll live. l have to end it. l definitely have to end it. - l have to end it, right? - Meredith, shut up. What? [Meredith] Did you seriously just tell me to shut up? Oh, please. You got a hot doctor who likes to make you open up, and say ''ahh.'' lt's the American dream, stop whining about it. No. No good can come from sleeping with your boss. - Cristina, you're late. - So is Meredith. [Meredith] Whatever it is we're afraid of, one thing holds true. That, by the time the pain of not doing a thing gets worse than the fear of doing it, it can feel like we're carrying around a giant tumor. When we walk in this door, you will maintain decorum. You will not laugh, vomit, or drop your jaw. Are we understood? [door opening] - Why would we laugh? - Oh, just you wait. Good morning, Miss Connors. [Miss Connors] Good morning. What is it? Tumor. [Meredith] And you thought I was speaking metaphorically. [? Psapp: Nobody Knows] Good morning, Annie. How are you? This is Dr. Bailey, and these are my fellow interns. Dr. Karev, we refer to patients as ''mister'' l told him to call me ''Annie.'' ''Miss Connors'' makes me feel old and fat, which l am, but why feel that way? [Burke] Good morning. Annie, this is Dr. Burke. [whispering] Awesome surgeon. Dr. Karev. Annie Connors is a 43-year-old woman who presented last night with progressive shortness of breath the past three months. Found to have a very large tumor of unknown origin pressed against her diaphragm. Stable vital signs. Scheduled for CT this morning, sir. Thank you, Dr. Karev. Are you at all claustrophobic? [Annie] l've been housebound for the last year. How claustrophobic could l be? [Burke] All right. Dr. Stevens is going to take you up for a CT. lt'll give us a better look at the tumor, - and we'll know how to proceed. - Could someone tell my mom? She'll worry if she gets back, and l'm not here. Yeah, of course. Of course. And would it be possible for Alex to take me instead? l mean, he He's just so fun to look at. [chuckling] Annie. [Burke] Sure. Sure, Ms. Connors. Excuse me. [lzzie] How much do you think it weighs? [George] 60 pounds. More. She's carrying a whole extra person. This one's going in the books. l've got to get in. l almost did. Have you ever seen Alex like that? He actually seemed sincere. ''Seemed'' being the operative word. He was on call when she came in. l am never leaving this place again. Let's move, people. Ms. Connor's surgery, should we choose to proceed, will take most, if not all, of the surgeons off the floor, which means you people will have to work extra hard not to kill anyone, 'cause we won't be there to fix your mistakes. [man] Dr. Burke. [woman over PA] Trauma team to OR one. Trauma team to OR one. l really want in on this. l thought we weren't talking. l'm not talking. l'm just saying. [sighing] Find her mother, get a family history, and l'll tell Bailey. [lzzie] Mr. Harper had a coronary bypass yesterday. His blood pressure, currently 1 00l65. lt was running low overnight down to 70l30, but responded to medication. Postoperative labs show a crit of 30 and normal coagulation. Chest-tube output has halted over the last two hours. [Bailey] What's your plan? Chest x-ray and check the tube for possible occlusion. Good. He's doing fine. [exhaling] Thank you. l know you think l like Meredith, but l don't like Meredith. What? No. l like Meredith. Obviously, l like Meredith. l just l just don't have a thing for her. OK. lt's just this morning l know you were probably just teasing, But l don't want you to say anything to her. We live together, and that'd be awkward. - George, stop talking. - OK, then. [elevator bell dinging] 'Morning. Mr. Levangie, this is Dr. Bailey and her fine staff of surgical interns. Welcome to hell, kids. [groaning] Who's presenting? Edward Levangie is a 63-year-old man admitted for pain management for Dyskinesia. He's been stable since last night, and responding to the bolus injections. - [Burke] lzzie, treatments? - [lzzie] For Parkinson's disease? Deep brain stimulation has Not for Parkinson's, for spinal pain. Oh, um lntraspinal catheter. That way, he can have constant pain medication. Excellent. This is Dr. Grey. She's gonna prep you for the procedure and assist. [pager beeping] Excuse me. You make yourselves busy, l'll catch up with you. [woman] l'll see you over there. Miranda. Excuse me? Well, that's your name, right? lt's on your jacket. All right, l'll just call you Bailey then. You think you're charming in that talented, neurotic, overly moussed hair sort of way, good for you. But if you think l'm going to stand back and watch while you favor her - l don't favor her. She's good. - l'm sure she is. Can l point out that, technically, l'm your boss? You don't scare me. Look, l'm not going to advertise your extracurricular activities with my intern. However, the next time l see you favoring Meredith Grey in any way, l'll make sure she doesn't see the inside of an OR for a month. Just for the sake of balance. [elevator bell dings] - We're all set, doc. - OK. There's going to be a microphone in there for you in case you get scared or you want to get out, but try not to do that, because then we're going to have to start all over again. l'm fine. l'll be fine. l know you're going to be fine, because l'm going to be right over there, waiting for you. - All right? - OK. You ready? Are you really ready? Let's do this. - [machine buzzing] - See ya. Oh, hey, man, you got an extra battery? Unbelievable. - Oh, l know, right? - l've never seen anything like this. God. Well, what l don't understand [over speaker]is how a person lets it get like that. I mean, man, that is a whole lot of nasty. [man] Maybe she's afraid of doctors. Poor thing. [Alex] Poor thing? Please. If you're afraid of doctors, you take a pill. She's just sick, like, warped, you know? Seriously, I don't know how she lives with herself. [laughing] Ugh. Well, at first, we thought she was just putting on weight. When we realized what was happening, l tried to get her to go to the doctor, but she was scared. And, the bigger it got, the less she wanted to go. And she never really felt all that sick until last night. She couldn't breathe. Because the tumor was crushing her lungs. Yes, well, l called 91 1 . lt just seemed like the right thing to do. You know, the right thing to do would have been to call a year ago. Thank you. [Meredith] OK, Mr. Levangie. We're going to get you more comfortable, OK? l'm going to go downstairs, and l'll be back up shortly. - [grunting] OK. - OK. [woman over PA] Cardiac perfusionist, 42 1 7. Excuse me. - l'm sorry, doctor - Grey. My dad seems to like you. He's always liked skinny blondes. ls that rude? l'm sorry. l'm so tired. ls there something? l was wondering if you would talk to him. About? Brain surgery. The doctor mentioned it, and l've read about it online. lf it worked, it could help with most of his symptoms, not just his pain. ls he a candidate? He is, but he's afraid of it. Surgery on his back, he can understand, but his brain And there are risks. - But his quality of life - There isn't any. And, it keeps getting worse. l'm getting married next month. l already lost my mom. And l want him to walk l want him with me. Maybe that's selfish, but You don't know what it's like having a parent Watching him l do. l do know what it's like. l'll see what l can do. Thanks. You're welcome. Thank you. The right hemidiaphragm is so high that it's completely displacing her lung tissue. lt's infiltrated her spinal canal in three places. We should start there. lt's going to take 3 or 4 hours to get around those nerves. l'd prefer to start in front, and then flip her. You never know what vessels are involved. l'm going to need a good head start. [Derek] lf l miss a step, she's paralyzed. lf l don't relieve the pressure on her lungs, she'll be dead. Do you think she really wants to live? Come on. She's been housebound. She's been living under this thing, just watching it grow for how long? She doesn't seem stupid. Doesn't even seem all that scared. Why would anyone wait this long, unless they wanted to die? People do things every day that they know could kill them. Doesn't mean they want to die. What are her chances of surviving the surgery? Slightly better than if we do nothing. So is it worth it? Hey, come on. You were already thinking it, l'm just saying. She's 43. lt's worth a try. [door opening] Ha! Morning. [woman over PA] Dr. Moretti, 467 2. Dr. Moretti, 467 2. Dr. Shepherd. Mr. Levangie, the Parkinson's patient, a good candidate for DBS? Yes, but he's not interested. OK, but l think it's worth talking to him again, pushing him. We're talking about a brain surgery that is performed while the patient is awake, a risk of paralysis, death. The patient doesn't want it. lt is not my job to push him into anything, and it's definitely not yours. OK You're uncomfortable with my decision. lt's best you don't scrub in. - But - lt's minor. You won't be missed. You know, they call you the Nazi. So l've heard. [woman over PA] Dr. Conserva, 37 42. Dr. Conserva, 37 42, stat. [Burke] l won't lie to you. The surgery is going to be long and difficult, but we have an extremely capable surgical team, and l can Am l going to die? There's always that risk, but if we don't do the surgery l'll definitely die. Yes. Soon? Yes. - Mom, the room's clean. - OK, honey, OK. - Mom! - She'll have the surgery. - Mom! - No. No, Annie. She will have the surgery. l guess l'll have the surgery. l think that is a very wise decision. On one condition. l don't want him there. l'm sorry, Annie. Did l upset you in some way? lf he's in the surgery, l'm not having it. That's how l live with myself. [Burke] OK, Miss Connors. Dr. Karev. - What the hell did you do? - Nothing. l-l don't know. Man. The mike must have been on. lf anything goes wrong, anything, you are 60 percent more likely to be sued if you've offended the patient. l never would have said that. The mike shouldn't have been on. l didn't realize she could hear me. Now you won't realize your chance to scrub in. You're banned from the OR. Mine or anyone else's. All week. l got the history on the tumor. lt's been growing for a year and a half. lt's the first time she's even had it looked at. lt's like she's fatally lazy. [sighing] Why doesn't she get banned? Go prep Annie Connors for surgery. You're scrubbing in with Cristina. Really? l mean, thank you. OK. We just need to recheck your labs and get an EKG, so l just need to take a little blood. Dr. Burke is great, and Dr. Bailey. - l know you're probably scared. - That's OK, kitten. You can just do your job. You don't have to talk to the fat, nasty tumor lady. l mean, l let it get this bad. How much sympathy do l deserve? Why did you let it get this bad? You're the first person since l got here to ask me that. Well, l guess it's just like the elephant in the room. - Elephant? - l mean lt's more like a giant sow, don't you think? Every time l went to the hospital, someone died. All four of my grandparents, then my dad. My best friend's mom, my baby sister. They all went in, never came out. So l put it off. You know, you're not the only one to put things off. l never do anything till the last possible minute. Like what? Well l've had this thing for my roommate since, like, day one, and l just l can't tell her. She probably wouldn't go out with me, anyway, but How do l know that for sure, if l don't ever ask? Seriously? You're equating your pathetic love life with my record-breaking tumor? Seriously? [ ? The Ditty Bops: Walk or Ride] lt's just that he blatantly favors me in front of her and then blatantly dismisses me. How do you know he was favoring you? Look, you've got a brain. You got into this program. Shepherd munching your cookies doesn't mean you didn't deserve what you worked for. But he's making me look bad. l have to end it. - Right. - lt's over. ls it true you get to scrub in on that tumor? - Don't sit here. - You get to scrub in? How psyched are you? On a scale of one to ecstatic, ecstatic. l think Burke wants to get into your scrubs. Why are you sitting here? He kicked me off that surgery for the same crap you pull every day. lf l stuck this fork into his thigh, would l get in trouble? Not if you make it look like an accident. - Hey. - Hi! Thank God, man. l'm drowning in estrogen here. You look ls everything OK? Shepherd's a jackass. Really? l think he's kind of great. He reamed her out in front of Bailey. - [lzzie] Why? - 'Cause he's a jackass. - Oh. - [tray clattering] Well, bad days are bad. [George] Maybe tonight, uh, if, you know, if you drink alcohol, l mean, we could all of us, l mean, go out and drink alcohol Because of the bad day. [pager beeping] l got to go. Dude. Shut up. [laughs] How's your back? - Still good. - Good. How are you? Can you lean forward for me? l want to check something. - Does that feel OK? - Yeah. - Right here? - Did you page? Mr. Levangie, have you given any more thought about the other surgical options we discussed this morning? What? Why would l? l already told you no. l'm letting you cut into my back, But that's not enough for you. All you guys ever want to do is cut. Dad, just listen to what he has to say. l already listened. Sir, there's a very small window of opportunity here. Once the Parkinson's progresses to a point of dementia, you're no longer a candidate for DBS. And when l'm no longer a candidate, is that when you people will leave me the hell alone! What? Do l have to start drooling, and forget my name to get a little peace and quiet? All right. l'll check back with you later. Try to get some rest. Dad, you're being unreasonable. The doctors are only trying to help you. lt's my damn life, and it's my damn brain. You want me to let them cut up my brain while l'm lying here awake, for what? - Dad! - l'll be at your wedding. l will sit in the back. Your uncle will walk you down the aisle. l know it's not perfect, but it's life. Life is messy sometimes. l know that. [sighs] lf she knows, then what the hell are we still talking for, huh? Why in hell can't she drop it? lt is your life. But it's her life too. And you have a chance to get better here. And all she's asking you to do is try. lf they pull this off, l'm totally calling Oprah. You two been working out? Sometimes l jog, and l try to take the stairs whenever possible. [Cristina] Why? See that large pile of tumor? You're going to be retracting it for the next 1 4 hours, so l'm just saying l hope you have strong backs. Dr. Shepherd. Yes? Mr. Levangie has agreed to DBS. lf we do it today. lf he leaves, he won't come back. Don't worry, Dr. Shepherd. lt'll take hours before we get around to the spine. - l'll page you. - All right, then. Let's do it. Dr. Bailey. l didn't know that he was my boss, when l met him. l didn't know. - l don't care. - Really? Oh, well, you sort of seemed to not be talking to me, so l You see this, what's happening right here? This is the problem with you sleeping with my boss. Not whether or not you knew him before, but how it affects my day. And me standing here talking to you about your sex life affects my day. And the longer this little fling goes on, the more favors you get over the others, who are fighting tooth and nail just to make it through this program without any assistance. When those people start finding out what's going on and they don't want to work with you and talk to you or look at you, and they start bitching and moaning at me, the more it affects my day. So, no, Dr. Grey, l don't care what you knew, or when you knew it. Are we understood? - Yes. - Good. [Alex] This sucks. l'm not a real fan of yours, either. Not you. This. Everyone is scrubbed in somewhere. Bright side, we have the run of the floor. Want to do it in the stairwell? l'm just saying you never know what could happen. [vomiting] l'm changing. l'll page you if l need you. You do that. You are so my favorite person today. - [machine beeping] - [doctors chattering] Begin more suction. We need to hang another bag of O-neg. Cauterizing the small bleeders to keep my visual field clean. God, is your back killing you? George, shut up. We're in here. [man] Hold it right there. Mrs. Harper, let me show you these chest films. We were able to relieve the obstruction of his chest tube, so the buildup of fluid you see should resolve itself soon. Which translates as he should be home in no time. He was making waffles. l'm sorry? He was making waffles. He was mixing the batter, and and then, he was on the floor. lzzie, we need a central line run in 204. - Page Dr. Karev, will you? - He's not answering. [sighs] l'm so sorry. l'll be back. [pager beeping] Like what you see, right? [woman] Neuro sponge. How you doing, Mr. Levangie? All right. Drill bit's charged. Where's blondie? l'm right here. Can't you see me? l'm shaky. l'm not blind. Anything goes wrong here, l'm blaming you. OK, in that case, l'll stay where you can see me. [woman] We have to drill a hole and try to find the spot that controls the motor function. You can't see my brain from there. Aren't you supposed to be learning something? l'm good, right here. - [woman] EEG waves look good. - OK, Mr. Levangie. Just take a couple deep breaths. - Focus on the pretty girl. - [whirring] [Derek] This is going to sound really scary, but try and relax. You shouldn't feel a thing. - Any pain here? Here? - No. - OK. - [pager beeping] Dr. Stevens, l need you to check the x-ray in 21 03. and Jane's wondering if you want her to start feeding 21 1 2. l'm going on break. OK, yeah, before you do that, could you page Dr. Karev again? - l already paged him. - Again? - [man] Irrigation. - [woman] Little more pressure. Excuse me. How is it? [man] Long and slow. l don't envy those two. They've been holding that thing for eight hours. Their arms have to be ready to fall off. [Burke] Look at the size of this artery. My God. lt's as thick as a thumb. You ever seen a vessel this size? No. This thing's just feeding on all her blood. We need more O-negative. [woman] l'll call the blood bank. [clinking] [Burke] Damn it, O'Malley. You want me to kill this patient? No, l Sorry. l mean, is the art of retracting just too much for you? No, l was, uh Um l had an itch. Way to go, George. Nicely done. Just keep trying, Mr. Levangie. Mimic my motions. You can do it. You're doing great, Mr. Levangie. Just a little longer. Oh, damn it! Take a breath and try again. One more time, Mr. Levangie. The probe is almost in. You'll know it when we find the right spot. [woman] Well, how about that? [Derek] There it is. l'll be a son of a bitch. [Derek] Bailey was on the warpath. l was trying to protect you. You trying to protect me is why she's on the warpath. You can't ask me to scrub in, when l haven't earned it. OK, OK. You can't treat me like crap when l haven't earned that. l can take care of myself. l got myself into this mess, and l And you'll get yourself out? l don't know that yet. [pager beeping] Don't let me keep you. You did great work here today. Dr. Shepherd. Yeah? Sorry l called you a jackass. You didn't. l did. Twice. Tell you what, blondie. lf you don't marry him, l will. [pager beeping] [pager beeping] No, no, no, Jimmy! No, no, Jimmy, no! - What we got? - Pressure plummeted to 64l22, and he has runs of V-tach that aren't perfusing. CVP is sky-high. - Give him dopamine, ten mikes. - He's maxed out. The resident was here an hour ago. l can't reach him. - Of course you can't. - Do something! What's the matter? - Get her out of here! - No, no! Mrs. Harper, you have to get out of here. Does he have a myocardial ischemia? No, it's a clot. Big one. - Page someone. - He'll be dead before they get here. You have to open him up, right here, right now. - You said he was OK! - Get out of here now! You have to cut. l can't. l've never seen it done. l could kill him. Do nothing, you'll kill him faster. - Your glove size? - Six. Oh, God. Oh, God. Take a breath, Dr. Stevens. She has to move over there. Walter, move out of the way. Cut the stitches and then the staples. Don't let them fall into the chest cavity. Wait. l've never cracked a chest before. Oh, God. Oh, God. No pulse. Wide complex rhythm. l can't get this clot out. l need more suction. l need more. He's bradying down. You have to get the clot out. l can't get it. Screw it. l'm using my hand. [woman] Oh, God, look at the size of that clot. Anything? No. You have to massage the heart, doctor. Come on. Come on. Come on, please. Come on, Mr. Harper. We have a pulse. [lzzie panting] OK, follow with suction. [Shepherd] How's it going? lt's more intertwined than the studies made it look. [Bailey] l need another bag. Call the blood bank. We need more O-negative. l'm down 1 0 units of blood, and l haven't even flipped her yet. Oh, wow. Hmm. Hold it steady. Look at that. Sponge. How am l supposed to get around that artery? Let me call down and see OK. All right, then. Forceps. Here you go. Excuse me. God, it's unbelievable. Right. How did she live like that? Watch what you say. You never know who's listening. [laughing] Look at George. He looks like he's about to fall in. Are you really as shallow and callous as you seem? Oh, you want to go out for a drink later and hear about my secret pain? Does that line ever work for you? Sometimes. Oh. Must be because you look like that. Like what? [chuckling] So is that a yes? No. l can't. l'm seeing someone. Look, if you don't want to go out with me, just say so. No need to lie. Oh, OK. Well, l don't want to go out with you. But l think l really might be seeing someone. [woman] Yeah. No, it's up here. It's up here. It's up here. We're still in the middle of surgery. Mr. Harper, the post-op heart patient in 21 1 4. l had to open his sternotomy bedside. - You what? - [all] What? What? He had cardiac tamponade. His chest films were clean this morning. lt happened fast. He was in PEA. There was no time. Go ahead. l got it. We're OK here. Yeah, l need some retraction. - Pull back on the retractor. - l got it. You opened a heart bedside, and you couldn't even page me? Needed all the glory for yourself, right? l paged you 50 times. Do you have any idea what l have been through? Oh, man. The battery. l forgot to change it. You forgot? You forgot?! You are hateful! You are a hateful, hateful, lazy, arrogant, hateful man! Hateful! Never a dull moment here at Seattle Grace. - Oh! - Oh, my God. Get right in there. She can't afford to lose this much blood. Get me some suction. l can't see what l'm doing. Clamp, clamp, clamp, please. ls there any blood in the rapid infuser? We're waiting on two units. What do you mean, waiting? We didn't anticipate this blood loss. We prepped double. We've used it all. - What did you cut? - [Bailey] Nothing. lt just blew. She came in with too much damage. The artery walls are too weak. Annie, come on. - Ten units of O-negative. - l cannot see. Give me your hand. Push down here. Pull it towards you. Suction! The pressure's dropping. Where the hell is the blood?! Somebody grab that. Push it back, George. Come on. [all panting] Oh, God. Just squeeze it off right there. Here we go. ls that O-negative for OR 1 ? Uh-huh, OR 1 . OR 1 , right? l got it! l got it! Some suction, please, in here, now. - [flatlining] - We're losing her now. Look at this. Come on. [flatlining continues] Oh, come on! Come on! [grunting] Come on! [panting] [monitor switches off] Time of death is 1 1 :42. l got it! [? Butterfly Boucher: Never Leave Your Heart Alone] [Meredith] The early bird catches the worm. A stitch in time saves nine. Messy. l'm sorry. Don't be. You saved his life. [Meredith] He who hesitates is lost. We can't pretend we haven't been told. We've all heard the proverbs, heard the philosophers, heard our grandparents warning us about wasted time, heard the damn poets urging us to seize the day. Still, sometimes, we have to see for ourselves. l'm not doing you any more favors. This was it. l've been holding up for the past 1 2 hours. My back's going to need traction, and the patient died anyways. And you think you did me a favor? Look, l'm just What is this .that we're doing here? What is it? You need a definition? You really want to be that guy? [Meredith] We have to make our own mistakes. Lock the door. We have to learn our own lessons. Have you seen Meredith? Save yourself the misery, man. She's off the market. What? No, that's not We're just friends. Whatever. But she's not. l mean, if she was seeing someone, l live with her, l would know it. [Meredith] We have to sweep today's possibility under tomorrow's rug until we can't anymore, until we finally understand for ourselves what Benjamin Franklin meant. That knowing is better than wondering. That waking is better than sleeping. l, um, know this place where there's an amazing view of sunrise over the ferryboats. l have a thing for ferryboats. l remember. And that even the biggest failure, even the worst, most intractable mistake beats the hell out of never trying.

                    			- Previously on Grey's Anatomy: - l've had this thing for my roommate, and l just l can't tell her. Wouldn't it be easier to just ask her out? Are you really as shallow and callous as you seem? Oh, you want to go out for a drink later and hear about my secret pain? l can't. l'm seeing someone. Save yourself the misery. - She's off the market. - What? But she's not. l live with her, l would know it. [Bailey] And the longer this little fling goes on, the more favors you get over the others, who are fighting tooth and nail just to make it through this program. When those people start finding out what's going on What is this that we're doing here? You need a definition? The next time l see you favoring Meredith Grey in any way, l'll make sure she doesn't see an OR for a month. [alarm beeping] [Meredith] OK, anyone who says you can sleep when you die, tell them to come talk to me after a few months as an intern. Of course, it's not just the job that keeps us up all night. You have to get up now. What? My God, what time is it? lt's 5:20, and l have pre-rounds. [Derek sighs] And you have to leave before they see you. Oh, come on, now. Why don't you just let them see? - [laughing] No! - Please! You get any sleep? Oh, she could oil the bedsprings as a courtesy or at least buy a padded headboard. - [sighs] - So who's the guy? You think it was just one guy doing all that work? Do you mind if l don't think about that? Oh, jealous? l'm not jealous. l am. But at least l know she'll be having a long day at work. [door opens] [? Jem: Wish I] Well, at least we know brain surgery isn't his only skill. They can't be He's her boss. We're late. He's all of our boss. [sighing] She has been scrubbing in a lot lately on his surgeries. No, Meredith wouldn't sleep with him just to No. lf she's not ashamed, why is it a secret? Maybe she didn't. Maybe it just happened. You know, spontaneously, last night. - Hi. Good morning. - Morning. lt sounded like you were having pretty radical sex last night, all night long. Who was the guy? No one you know. [chuckling] We're late. Let's go. [Meredith] If life's so hard already, why do we bring more trouble down on ourselves? What's up with the need to hit the self-destruct button? Yikes, wouldn't want to meet you in a dark alley. Right back at you. [lzzie] A run? You run? Every day, babe, every day. Not suffering enough? What doesn't kill you, makes you stronger. Don't go acting all indefatigable. You're dragging like the rest of us. Oh, what is that, professional weakness, Dr. Yang? - lt's called the flu. - Yeah. l need a major rush to make it through this day. l need a kick-ass surgery. Ooh, you a bad boy last night, George? That would be Meredith. You a bad boy, Meredith? Do tell. Nothing to tell. That says it all, huh? Sorry, l have a sex life. Don't apologize. Embrace it. Share it. Count me in. Next time, just let me know if l need to go to a hotel so l can get some sleep. [woman over PA] IV nurse, ICU. Am l missing something? You were just a little loud. Do they know it's McDreamy keeping them up all night? l hope not. l already have Bailey riding me. l don't need my roommates thinking l'm getting special treatment. [yawning] O'Malley, Yang, Karev, go on to clinic. O'Malley, patients are waiting. You two come with me. [Bailey] lzzie, you're hanging with me today. Good morning, Dr. Shepherd. Dr. Bailey. Late night, Grey? No, caffeine just hasn't kicked in yet. lf you're at all religious, you want to start praying it kicks in soon. There's a consult in the pit. Girl with a fever and abdominal pain. After that, Nicholas in 331 1 needs his meds. Mr. Moeller's lV fell out, and he's a hard stick. Postops in 1 337, 3342, Three-eighty-one. Thirty-three-forty-two, 3363 and 23 Why are you still standing in front of me? You look more like me than you right now. - What's the matter? - Nothing. [woman] Help! l need immediate help. What's the problem? My damn boyfriend swallowed my keys. [wheezing] l didn't want her to leave. Locate the lady's keys. l think she got some bug on her trip to Mexico with her friends. l told her not to go to a Third-World country, but does she ever listen? [man] She's been weak ever since, and she's lost weight. Barely. And this morning, she passed out in the shower. When was the trip? A couple weeks ago. l'm really fine. l just have a fever. OK, well, will you lie back for an exam for me? No, please, l don't need an exam. Just give me some antibiotics and send me home. Well, maybe it is just a fever, but they called down for a surgeon, so l have to give the OK to let you go. So just let me do the exam. Do the exam. No. [sighing] This is crazy. l'm fine. For God's sake, Claire, l don't want to spend my entire day here. You know, actually, Mrs. Rice, this might be easier if we had some privacy. So would you two mind leaving the room? [Mr. Rice] That's fine. Digby. Digby Owens. l have an appointment. Excuse me, sir, uh, you're bleeding. You mind if l Sure, sure. Have a look. - That's a gunshot. - Yeah. We got a gunshot wound. We got to get him down to the pit. Sit, Mr Uh Digby. All right, but it isn't an emergency. - l scheduled it. - What, the gunshot? Yeah. My buddy shot me. - Buddy? - Yeah, just as a favor. - On purpose? - Hell, yeah. He wasn't trying to hurt me, but you know - But why? - l like the scars. [? Psapp: Nobody Knows] Look, everyone in town has tats, but my art is about commitment. So, this your art, huh? [Digby] Damn straight. Damn stupid. The bullet went all the way through. Bounced off my ribs. l have another one still in my shoulder. Nice, huh? You could hang it in the Louvre. l have an ethos. Why do anything unless you're willing to go one step further than anybody else? What doesn't kill you makes you stronger. Exactly. And pain is the great divide. My coach used to say, it's all about how we process pain. Football? Wrestling, lowa State. lowa, 1 41 . One-fifty-seven. You got to be more than 1 80 now. l'd like to see you get back under 1 45. Excuse me, but thinking of you men in tights makes me want to puke. There's a flu going around the hospital. Somewhat ironic. [Claire] Ow. Don't push so hard. Can you lift your shirt so l can examine your stomach? Where did you get these? Claire you've had surgery recently. These scars are still pink. Don't tell my parents. You did this in Mexico so your parents wouldn't know? What did you have done? [George] Ahh. And you noticed her foot twitching? - Come on, Jamie. - My foot. Oh, yeah. About three months ago? Just a little. We took her to County Hospital, and she got the CT scan, which showed her Brain abnormality. Here, you can put it - And the twitching has gotten worse? - A lot worse. They don't have the proper equipment back home to figure out what's wrong. - You did a you did a good thing. - Show Mommy. - Yes, your mommy. - Show Mommy and Daddy. You did a good thing by coming all this way, Mr. and Mrs. Hayes. You sit tight, Jamie, OK? l'm gonna bring Dr. Shepherd to see you. OK? Dr. Shepherd. OK? He's the brain specialist. [Jamie] Mommy and Daddy. Doctor? ls he good, this Dr. Shepherd? At just about everything. [Bailey] l assume the lady needs her keys to leave this guy's sorry ass behind. - Yeah. - Well, help her out. He needs a bronchoscopy. See one, do one, teach one. You've seen one. lt's time to do one. Alone? Seriously? Thanks. l mean, the vote of confidence in my skills and all. l didn't think anyone was noticing how hard - lzzie? Go. - Yeah. - You paged? - Where are we? l did the consult, did the lV, the meds, the postops, everything. How is your pit patient? She's febrile and has peritoneal signs. You all right, Dr. Yang? Fine. On my way back to clinic. l think she had some sort of illegal surgery done in Mexico. Botched abortion? She has four laparoscopic scars on her abdomen and won't say what they're from, the parents are clueless. - She's a minor. - Seventeen. Freshman in college. - You order up for a CT? - Yes. So while she's there, the nurses couldn't get a Foley on Mr. Garay. He may need a Coude cath if you can't get a normal one in there. Write up postop notes on all surgical-floor patients that had surgery within the last 24 hours. Be sure to document their EKGs and x-rays. Hunt them down if you can't find them. Right away. Hey. Whoa. Got the flu? Yeah, and thanks for it. lt's making my life so much easier. l didn't give it to you. lt's all over the hospital. - You should be in bed. - [scoffs] Disease, diagnosis and prescription from one man. Seriously, l'll give you a ride home. This is not gonna make me go home. You go home. But l feel fine. Hey, hey, hey. Have you seen Shepherd? Not as up close as Meredith has. What? Are you trying to get her in trouble? This program will make or break our careers. Some of us will make it through, and some of us won't. And that decision depends entirely on recommendations from doctors like Shepherd. There is a reason we don't sleep with the attendings. lt's not her fault, it's Shepherd's. He's taking advantage of her. lt didn't sound like anything was happening against her will last night. OK, we're in good shape here. [nurse] l think so, Dr. Shepherd. [Derek] Looks good. [monitor beeping] Here you go, doc. The kid's CTs just arrived from County. - Thanks. - Excuse me. - Sorry, Dr. Taylor. - [door closes] That would be bourbon. - What? - l smelled it too. And he's the best anesthesiologist on the staff. l'll worry when he's too juiced to do his crossword puzzle. [Derek] Will you close up for me? Thank you, everyone. - Dr. Shepherd - l got to get some coffee. Jamie Hayes has been admitted. The little girl with the brain abnormality. How's she presenting? She has what looks like continuous seizure activity in her left foot. - Her balance is off. - How old are these? - Three months old. - l need new ones. Her brain could look dramatically different today. OK, l'll order them Thank you. doc. [Burke] And that? That's a bullet from a previous gunshot. Previous gunshot? OK. No reason to take it out. No, the guy likes pain. lt's his ethos. Pain as an ethos? Wait, l think l know this guy. You remember this guy? Hey, the tattooed masochist. Had himself shot again. Glad to see he's still stupid. lt's his ethos. Let's go tell him what he gets to do today. Dr. Bailey? Claire Rice's abdominal CTs. ls this girl fat? Not at all. She's a normal college kid. So, what do you see? Her stomach's stapled. [Meredith] She's had a gastric bypass. And a bad one, at that. Gastric bypass is a procedure normally done on obese patients to help them lose weight. Claire? She doesn't need to lose weight. Are you kidding? This means the world to her. But it is so typical of this girl to take the easy way out. She's done it with everything since she was a little kid. Nothing about this is gonna be easy. She's gonna face a lifelong struggle with malnutrition unless she has surgery to reverse the procedure. Do the surgery. l told her to watch the freshman 1 5. Don't eat junk, exercise. But when she came home Christmas, who had to buy her a pair of size-6 jeans because she couldn't get in the ones l got her? Tina, you know, she tries so hard. - [sighs] - She does. She gets good grades. She gets A's. She has illegal surgery in Mexico. Unfortunately, there were complications with the bypass. What do you mean? She has what looks like an abscess under her diaphragm, an edema, which is a swelling of the bowel wall. l can't say for certain she'll recover completely. [sighs] Just do whatever you have to do to make her well, OK? You look like a princess. [Jamie] lt's not lipstick. [Derek] lt's not lipstick? No, it's not lipstick. Want to do my shoulder? Oh, good. [Jamie] And nose? We're gonna find out what's causing these seizures. - Does MRl know we're coming down? - You said CT. Now l'm saying MRl. lt's available. Good. Doctor, is she gonna need surgery? l don't know yet. l don't know if our insurance We know it can be very expensive. l don't want you to worry about that. lt's a focal, left-size seizure. Let's get that diazepam running now, please. [Derek] Jamie, here's what we're gonna do. We're gonna put this on your arm. lsn't that fun? Here, we're gonna put that onto you, like that. And this is gonna feel cold. This is a butterfly. [fluttering] Butterfly lands right there. Mmm, there we go. Blanket for the butterfly. Good, nicely done. lt's amazing stuff, isn't it? [sighs] Uh-huh. - Hey, you like spaceships? - Yeah. OK, should we take Captain O'Malley, my first lieutenant, to the spaceship MRl? Let's go. lt'll be safer to wait until your lunch digests before we do the procedure. Perfect, this is just perfect. l was hoping to be in Portland right now. You'll be under conscious sedation, which means you'll be awake, but groggy. [wheezing] Wait, wait. ls this gonna hurt? We'll give you something for pain. Do you know how stupid you make me look? l thought you would think this is funny. Funny? Romantic? [woman] The therapist thing was funny and romantic? - [man] That was funny. - No, that was sad. He called my therapist, pretending to be his therapist, - to find out what l'd said. - Passive-aggressive, JP? He is the king of passive-aggressive. And he's manipulative - [JP grunts] - and needy. Well, that's the trifecta. What do l win? [wheezing] What? Doc! l prefer we stop meeting like this, Mr. Owens. Digby. So how's the trumpet playing? Very safe, compared to your hobby. Getting shot is a little more risky. That's kind of the point. He's running a fever. Due to the extra stress on his body from the gunshot. Digby, the impact of the bullet on your chest fractured a rib and caused a hemopneumothorax. That sucks, l guess. There's blood in your collapsed lung. The price of body art went up. Ah, no pain, no gain, right? [Burke] That's one way to look at it. We have that in common, you docs and me. [Burke] Do we? Yeah, the way you guys push, push and push. When l was wrestling, if you wanted to pin me, you was gonna have to kill me. [chuckles] lowa-style. [Digby] lowa-State-style. Back home, we were sworn enemies. But in Seattle, man, we're brothers. [chuckles] [coughs] So, what are we gonna do about this, um hemopneumo-Jurassics? lnsert a chest tube to drain the blood, then re-inflate your lung. Oh, please tell me l get to watch. Oh, man, lowa-style. Before you guys start, l know you're mad. Disbelief, Claire, just disbelief. [Mr. Rice] l'm just concerned. Where did you get the idea to do this? The lnternet. Honey, there is a healthy way to lose weight. [Claire sighs] Yeah, l tried that, but lt doesn't work for me like it does for you. [Mr. Rice] Hey, you don't need to lose weight. What are you eating? And how much have you been working out? Most of the time, when people hit their target weight, they have to work to stay there. Everyone gains weight in college, Mom. lt's it's stressful. There's there's not enough time for exercise. l just thought if l wasn't worried about my diet, then l could focus more on my studies. So you took yet another shortcut? Life doesn't work that way, Claire. [Mr. Rice] Tina! What? You want to argue this? She has so much potential. lf she would just apply herself OK, l think we should focus on taking care of your daughter. And, Claire, your parents agree, the best thing to do is to reverse the bypass. No! No, it's my body. l do not want surgery again. Please? There are serious complications. And this is about your health. But l'd rather be thin. Well, l'm afraid the choice isn't up to you. lt's called Rasmussen's encephalitis. What it amounts to is that this side of her brain This part's healthy, working perfectly. This black part of the brain, this all of that is dead, or dying. The condition has gotten radically worse since her CT scans three months ago. Left untreated, the disease is gonna kill her. How soon? [Derek] Too soon. [Mr. Hayes] So is there a cure? The treatment requires the diseased portion of her brain be removed and sealed off. [Derek] See, eventually, the spinal fluid will fill the cavity. R-Remove? But, l mean, that's Half her brain, yes. Half her brain. That seems impossible. [Derek] Her age makes it possible. Her brain's not fully developed, so the remaining neurons will compensate. But will she be normal? There are risks to any surgery, and this is, you know, a major one. But if we're successful, Jamie could walk out of this hospital in a couple weeks, go on to live a relatively normal life. Look, l know this is a lot to digest. The important thing is we can save her life. Thank you. - Dr. O'Malley? - Yes? What? lf the parents consent, l thought you'd like to scrub in on the hemispherectomy. Are you in, or not? Uh, in. Good. [elevator dings] [George] Yay. l'm scrubbing in on a hemispherectomy with Shepherd. Get out! l would kill for that. We're gonna cut out half a girl's brain, and it's going to work. lt's outrageous. Almost makes it hard to hate him. - Why do you hate him? - Oh, no reason. You know about him and Meredith? You know? When are you gonna figure out that l know everything? She knows. - [lzzie] What, about doctor-cest? - lt's been going on for, like, ever. - And you didn't tell us? - Ooh, you're a gossip, huh? - l am not! - l am. He's about to go into major brain surgery on no sleep? Not very responsible. Jealous? Sex all night isn't about being responsible. No, it's about sex all night. l can't believe you're not more pissed off. Well, she works hard all day. She's good at her job. Why should you care how she unwinds? You like to bake all night. Some people like to drink. Others like a screaming orgasm. [Alex] Yeah, we do. Forget l said that. Pretend like l'm not here. [Alex] Continue. You look like you need to be spoon-fed. You look like Alex. Yeah, about drinking, Dr. Taylor, the anesthesiologist - Do you think he drinks? - Whatever gets you through the day. l mean here, at work. Earlier, l thought l smelled Do you think? l mean, his patients trust that [sighs] So l should say something, right? lt's a can of worms, George. Weren't we talking about sex, anyway? - Doofus. - Ew. This is gonna leave a pretty sexy scar, huh? Don't get any more crazy ideas. [Digby] You really think my ideas are crazy? l'm leaning that way. We wrestle, he plays trumpet. Hey, l feel pretty dizzy. You've lost some blood. [Digby] This, too, shall pass. Hey How come l don't see you down at the Mat in Belltown? Oh, man, no time. Bro, make time. [chuckles] l'll be expecting you. l'm there. [whimpers] Handle with care. This thing's Full of gunk. l know. We need to free the bowel from the adhesions caused from the abscess. This poor girl. What was she thinking? She wants her mother's approval. She wanted to please her. And this damage is the result? Here, resect that. Needle-tip Bovie, please. When you're done here, you have postops waiting. l know, Dr. Bailey. Cristina's got the flu. You need to pick up the slack. Look, l'll mop the floors, OK? Sorry, that was inappropriate. lt's not the only thing that's inappropriate. You care to tell me what you think you're doing? l'll jump through hoops if you want me to. But what l do when l leave this hospital is my business. Half this hospital knows. Flu isn't the only virus spreading around here. l made a choice, and l know you don't respect me for that choice. But l'll live with the consequences. Then l'll have lots of hoops for you to jump through. l've done everything you've asked me to do. l may not do it your way, but it gets done. So whatever else you got, bring it on. - Ew! - [laughter] OK, Dr. Grey, now that you've drained the organ, we can attempt to repair it. Now my day is perfect. OK, bye. l appreciate this. The chance to scrub in on this kind of procedure is, well Yeah, l appreciate it. Here you go. Triple espresso, not too hot. Oh, l love you, seriously. Ah, coffee, where would medicine be without it, huh? l hope you have a new crossword, Taylor. We're gonna be here a while. Never go without. Big day for you, kid. Congrats. Thanks. Hey, princess. You ready to take a nap? - Hey, look what l got. - Blow bubbles, that's it. [Derek] Just breathe in. Oh, that's it. - What? - Do you smell? Smell what? l have a mask. Uh l'm sorry, Dr. Taylor, but did you just? Have you been drinking? l beg your pardon? - [Derek] What? - [George] Do you smell l l smell alcohol. [Taylor] Where do you get off accusing me of something like that? George, you're out of line. There are rules. You know, there are rules for a reason. You ju There is a 2-year-old girl on this table. You shouldn't take advantage of someone else's vulnerability. l don't need some punk intern telling me what's at stake here. Get him out of here, Shep. [Taylor] Shep? You're out, George. You damn well better be ready, Taylor. l wouldn't be here if l wasn't. [monitor beeping] [woman] Do you really, seriously want to know why l'm leaving?! How about when you started insisting that l quit my job, when l made more money than you? That should have been the last straw. The last straw should have been when l found out those phone calls that you kept denying were from other women were really coming from your mother! This isn't healthy. - Hold still, please. - Don't you dare try to patch this up! Could the both of you please stop? You don't love me, JP. You love to smother me. And if l could just get you to admit that, then l could leave you with an ounce of respect. Athena, l let you stay in here to keep him calm. lf you're gonna keep Check that. l can't respect a man desperate enough to swallow my exit strategy. That is the last straw! Michelle, can you get her out of here? [Michelle] Ma'am? - Fine! - [choking] - Come on. - What? What's happening? The keys moved farther down. Oh, my God, what does that mean? What did you do? Don't you dare die, JP! Please! Please, just shut up! Breathe, JP. Just breathe. [grunting] [lzzie] Got it. [choking] [gagging] [coughing] Very impressive, JP. [sighs] ls he OK? ls he gonna be OK? Yeah, he'll be fine. [panting] [JP chuckling] You lit You did that on purpose, didn't you? [sighs] Can l offer you some advice? Get in your car and go, for all of our sakes. You're never gonna find where l parked it. [Meredith] l need a shower. l need a shower. You need to go tell that girl's parents what kind of kid they're getting back. You're not gonna let me shower first? That would be a hoop, would it not? lt would qualify. Shower first, then. Ew, what smells? That would be me, or more specifically, my patient's insides all over me. That makes me strangely happy. Oh, God. Oh, Meredith, you smell like Karma. - What? - Nothing. Something vile's stuck in your hair. You know, just go stand over there, please. Ugh, how much do l love being a surgeon right now? Karma. What does karma have to do with anything? l'm just saying, you've been given all the best surgeries. And now you smell like putrid goo. And you're giving off a stench. Karma's a bitch. [Bailey] Dr. Shepherd needs an intern. - Which one of you is clear? - Where do you want me? - You need to lie down somewhere. - l'm completely healthy. Grey? - [sighs] Of course. - What is your problem? Um, you! 'Cause apparently, you can help Dr. McDreamy in ways the rest of us can't. - You did not just s - Yes, l did! [Bailey] Hey! Hemispherectomy in OR 1 with Dr. Shepherd. Go. Apparently, l'm not the only one with hoops. [? Tegan and Sara: Downtown] - Doctor. - [Burke sighs] Digby's postop CBC shows a severe spike in the white blood cell count. What is it? lt's 27, with 1 6 percent bands. Something else is wrong. That's a little high for simple stress. Check for any other possible sources of infection or recent illness. [Derek] We're gonna start the procedure with the left temporal lobectomy. Thanks for joining us, Dr. Yang. After the temporal, we'll do the frontal, and then the occipital. We were able to reverse the gastric bypass, but we did lose a significant portion of her bowel. And because of the short gut syndrome, Claire will never eat normally again. OK, wait, do? How do we help her here? Well, getting proper nutrition will be a lifelong problem for Claire. Great, as if we already don't have our hands full with her. She gets good grades. She stays out of trouble. She's smart. l just think she feels like nothing she does is good enough for you. lf you think that l'm responsible for this l think Claire is killing herself to please you. [scoffs] Oh, please. You have no idea what's going on in that girl's mind. You're her mother. She worships the ground you walk on. She didn't do this for herself. [clearing throat] l think that this situation Tina Shut up. What is it? l'm freezing, doc. l-l can't stop shaking. His temp's way up, and BP's dropping, doctor. Digby, have you had any recent illnesses, new piercings, tattoos, wounds? New tat on my calf. [panting] Ew. Oh, my God. lt was nowhere near that nasty this morning. lt was infected? Why didn't you say anything? Ah, it was nothing. l'm not here to complain about a little pain. [Alex] The infection's been exacerbated by the stress from the gunshot. Get him to lCU. We'll get you started on some antibiotics. From the frontal lobectomy, l'm going to encounter a, uh [Cristina] We'll encounter the anterior cerebral artery. Yes, so we're gonna need to, uh [sighing] The branches of the artery need to be coagulated and divided. You know, Taylor, her anesthesia's awful light. Come on, Taylor, s-she's waking up. Dr. Taylor? Uh, he's asleep! Taylor! Dr. Taylor! Huh? Oh, God, sorry. Sorry, l'm on it. [sighs] [Taylor] My bad, Shep. He was right, wasn't he? Aw, l nodded off. Come on. Whatever you got to do to get through the day. Steph, get me some coffee. [Steph] Yes, doctor. l'll be fine. lt won't happen again. Yeah, not in here, it won't. Uh, Steph, call Dr. Pennington. Hopkins, take over until she gets here. Get out of here. What happened? Multisymptom organ failure, secondary to overwhelming sepsis. Now he's all Fix his BP, that should help his mental status. He's maxed out. We got V-tach. [Burke] He's looking bad. Put the defib pads on him and give him 1 50. [flatlining] l lost his pulse. Defib! Get the pads! Get the pads! Clear. Again at 300. Clear. [? Joe Purdy: Suitcase] Come on. This packing, we hope, will prevent hemorrhaging. Dr. Yang, do you want to add something to that? lt will allow the cerebral spinal fluid to eventually fill the cavity. Hmm, very nice. - You two, you wanna close up? - [woman] Yes, doctor. l'm gonna go to bed. [sighs] That was unreal. l mean, that's that's all there is. l l was feeling sick until l came here. l was tired. Now l'm tired again. lt's back to reality. - Let me explain. - lt's fine. There is a code among doctors. We're not supposed to ask each other questions within the walls of this hospital. OK, l was out of line. No, you weren't. l was. l was out of line. Somebody should have taken responsibility. lt should have been the guy doing the cutting. lt should have been me. You didn't deserve what happened to you today. You did the right thing, code or no code. [scoffing] You saw me leave the house this morning, didn't you? Oh, was that you? Hmm. l'm not using her. And l don't favor her. She's pretty great, you know. Mm-hmm. So let's go tell Jamie's parents she's gonna be fine, barring any complications. [George clears throat] Did you fix me? No, not completely. So l won't get fat? No. Oh. That's awesome. Claire, l've asked social services to contact your parents. Why? [Meredith] They can help you. With what? [sighing] You don't know this yet, but life isn't supposed to be like this. lt's not supposed to be this hard. [sighs] Time of death, 20:49. The first guy l ever met out here from back home. l thought you'd be asleep by now. Yeah, well, l'm not. lf you wait a few minutes, you can have a piece of cake. Baked it chock-full of love. Actually, chock-full of unrelenting, all-consuming rage and hostility, but it's still tasty. - So you know? - l know. Well, do you want the long, sordid version, or the short version, where l started sleeping with a guy who turned out to be my boss? Neither. lzzie, cut me some slack here. No. You went to Dartmouth. Your mother is Ellis Grey. You grew up Look at this house! You know, you walk into the OR, and there isn't anyone who doubts that you should be there. l grew up in a trailer park. l went to state school. l put myself through med school by posing in my underwear. You know, l walk into the OR, and everyone hopes l'm the nurse. Y-you have their respect without even trying, and you're throwing it away for what? A few good surgeries? No. lt's not about the surgeries. lt's not about getting ahead. [lzzie] Then what? A little hot sex? You're willing to ruin your credibility over that? l mean, Meredith, what the hell are you doing? Oh, my God. You're falling for him. l am not. Oh, you so are. No, l'm not. You so are. Damn it, you poor girl. You know, it's just that he's just so And l'm just l'm having a hard time. Wow, you're all, uh, mushy and warm and full of secret feelings. l hate you! And your cake. My cake is good. So, um, how hot is the sex? lzzie. What? Come on, l'm not getting any. Help a girl out with a few details. [rowing machine whirring] [bangs] [Meredith] Maybe we like the pain. Pooh. How's she doing? - Good. - Good. [Meredith] Maybe we're wired that way. Cristina? Because without it, I don't know maybe we just wouldn't feel real. You know, we could just Sleep? We could, yeah, if if you want to. Yeah? [Meredith] What's that saying? ''Why do I keep hitting myself with a hammer?'' Oh, thank God. ''Because it feels so good when I stop. ''

                    			- Previously on Grey's Anatomy: - How hot is the sex? - [Derek] Some call this a relationship. - [Meredith] I know nothing about you. We're having sex every night. - l deserve details. - You have more than most. What makes a hotshot leave the Big Apple for Seattle? Thanks for the coffee. [gasping] [woman] Adoption? Keeping the baby? l know this is a difficult decision. - l'm not interested. - l am not your sister! l am a man! You need to get laid. See that nurse there? She's single. She's got red hair. Go ask her out. Smooth moves, doctor. - Who is that? - That's Dad. - [woman] Diagnosis? - [Meredith] Alzheimer's. She doesn't want anyone to know. l'm the only person she'll allow to see her. [? A.M. Sixty: Big as the Sky] [Meredith] Secrets can't hide in science. Medicine has a way of exposing the lies. Within the walls of the hospital, the truth is stripped bare. How we keep our secrets outside the hospital Well, that's a little different. [doorknob rattling] [lzzie] George. You locked the door. l need to take a shower. Uh, uh, l'll be out in a minute. What are you doing in there? [George] lt's private. Oh. Oh, God. l'm sorry. l get it. - [laughing] l don't mean to interrupt. - No, it's not that! [lzzie] lt's OK. Take your time. l am not doing what you think l'm doing. There's really no need to explain. l'll wait. You just finish. No, l'm l'm coming. l'm coming out! [Meredith] One thing is certain. Whatever it is we're trying to hide, we're never ready for that moment - when the truth gets naked. - [cell phone ringing] Dr. Grey, this is Ms. Henry from the nursing home. - l'm calling about your mother. - Is she all right? Oh, it's nothing like that. Can I call you later, then? - Uh, I just wanted to - l have to go. Oh, my God. Who is calling you at this hour? lt's a wrong number. There's no reason to be ashamed. lt's normal. Healthy, even. l'm not ashamed 'cause l wasn't doing anything. - l don't have to. l have a girlfriend. - An imaginary girlfriend? An actual girlfriend. You know what? lt's no big deal. You don't have to lie. l get it. You have needs. Oh! What is going on out here? Nothing. - Nothing. - Nothing. He's freaked out 'cause l caught him playing with little Jimmy and the twins. l have a girlfriend. [lzzie] OK. This sounds like fun out here. [cell phone ringing] Aren't you gonna get that? Might be the hospital. lt's not. Breakfast? [Meredith] That's the problem with secrets. Like misery, they love company. No, look, l told you people l'm not coming in for a counseling session. l know all my options. Uh, well, l made my decision, and l made my appointment. l'll be there on the 1 6th. They pile up and up until they take over everything. - l paged you last night. - Oh, l wasn't on-call. That's not why l paged you. You could give me your home number. Um, Burke [Cristina sighs] Uh, l gotta go. [Meredith] Until you don't have room for anything else. Until you're so full of secrets, you feel like you're going to burst. l had a really good time the other night. Yeah, me too. Are you, uh, feeling OK and everything? l'm good. Great, now that l got to see you. Why? Oh, no reason. l'm good too, you know? Really good. You know. But, um, a little itchy. Hi, George. - Hey. - Olivia. Hi, Dr. Stevens. l'll see you later. OK. Bye. Yeah. She's into me. Way to go, George. She's cute. So this morning, you really weren't Anytime you want to apologize Then what were you doing in the bathroom for so long? l have to go. Um l know l'm pretty to look at and all, George, but back up. l need to ask you something. l'm waiting. l seem to be having this skin thing going on, like a rash, really. And l think l know what it is, but l can't get close enough to tell for sure. Let's see it. lt's kind of located in an, um, you know, private You're a doctor, George. lt's called a penis. You have a rash on your penis? l think l can describe it. Um, it's k Red. Look, just come on. Just show me your junk so we can get this over with. So? Dude, you've got syphilis. [groaning] [? Psapp: Nobody Knows] [Alex] Patient presented with abdominal pain and blood in his urine. Once his workup came back unrevealing, the urologist suggested a cystoscopy. Reason? To get a look inside the bladder. l appreciate you doing this, Preston. l know this is a little out of your field. That's not a problem. lt gives my interns something to do. l have a feeling you keep them plenty busy. We were in the same frat at Tulane. lt's gone from torturing pledges to torturing interns. Am l right? Be very careful how you two answer that. [man] l could tell some stories. Bill, you have a camera snaking up your mojo. lt's not the time to cross me. lt isn't anything too serious? That's what this procedure will tell us. You don't worry about anything but growing my godson in there. He kicks like you wouldn't believe. A badass, just like his father. Move a little to the right. [Burke] Your other right. There. What do you see? What is it? [Burke] Could be any number of things. O'Malley, take a biopsy of the mass. Dr. Karev, schedule a CT. Let's not worry until we have to. [monitor beeping] [Richard] There's too much damage. We'll have to remove most of the colon instead of a local resection. Mmm. You gotta push it up. [clearing throat] [clearing throat] More suture. And what's with these damn lights in here? [Cristina] Mr. Franklin, how long has your abdomen been like this? lt's been getting bigger for a while. l told him there was something wrong. No one gets fat like this so fast. l told him. Everybody told him. He has dullness to percussion and spider angiomas. What's all that mean? We have to run some tests. Great. What's that gonna cost us this time? Alice, don't. Hi, uh, results for George O'Malley? l don't see it here. What's the patient's name? O'Malley, George. Look, it's just a simple blood test. Here you go. Thank you. [sighing] Franklin, Jordan. l need these back ASAP. What a shocker. Hey, what did you get, something good? Syphilis? That's not surgical. Who has syphilis? Excuse us. Sorry. - You have syphilis? - Shh! - l don't know how this happened. - Of course you do. Olivia must really be getting around. She's not like that. lt's a new millennium, George. The only people who aren't like that are the Amish and, apparently, you. You don't know. Maybe l've been sleeping around. Maybe l got ladies. Shut up. - What am l gonna do? - lt's no biggie. - Penicillin'll knock it out. - What am l gonna do about Olivia? For starters, stop sleeping with her, unless you want that thing to fall off. [George] OK, that is twice that you have trash-talked the girl that l could one day potentially Well, not love, but like a whole lot. lf she gave it to you, you have to tell her. Three. Fine. She didn't give it to you. She was a virgin when you met. You still have to tell her so she can get tested. Oh, yeah? How am l gonna tell her? ''Uh, hey, Olivia. How you doing? By the way, l got the syph. How about you?'' Maybe not quite like that. No, it's good advice, really good advice. Thank you very much. [Richard] Retract here. Oh! This just isn't holding. Give me a bigger retractor, please. [woman] Sorry, doctor. [Richard] lt wasn't you. [clearing throat] Dr. Bailey, you can finish this. Uh, thank you, chief. l appreciate the opportunity. l'll just [Alex] l gotta say, George, l didn't think you had it in you. lt's always the quiet ones. - So who's the woman? - None of your business. Oh, come on. Who gave you the cooties on the playground? You must have had something like this before, right? l never talk about my penis with other men. l don't n either, normally. We better get Burke. [knocking on door] Mr. Franklin? You have a condition known as ascites. Oh, my God. l knew it was terrible. lt just means there's fluid in the peritoneal cavity. The abdomen. The swelling is pressing against your lungs, which is why you're having trouble breathing. lt looks like a symptom of liver disease. And it all comes together. Alice, not now. ls there something we should know? l drink a bit. That's the understatement of the year. - That's enough out of you. - Hey! l'm only here for Mom, to make sure you don't pull any of your usual crap. There's definitely a growth protruding into the bladder, but look at the edges. - l don't think it's a tumor. - Kind of shaped like an ovary. That the answer you're gonna give your patient? This's one of my oldest friends. - You might want to take this seriously. - l'm sorry. You better be. l got the rest of the labs back. They did a chromosome analysis of the tissue. You won't believe this. Bill has an ovary? Um, according to his daughter, Mr. Franklin is a heavy drinker. Six to eight drinks a day, an alcoholic by any standard. - Protocol? - Schedule a paracentesis. Reason? Draining the fluid'll relieve pressure. Good, but don't schedule it. Do it. You want us to do the procedure? - You've seen one, right? - Absolutely. Well, now do one. l've never seen one. You're about to. Oh, my God. God, an ovary. lt gives new meaning to the term ''metrosexual.'' - Hi, George. - Olivia. What am l, invisible? Alex. You go ahead. l'll catch up with you later. About time l got you alone today. - Olivia - What time is your shift done? Because mine's over at 8, and l thought maybe you could come over. l need to tell you something. What's wrong? Are you breaking up with me? What? No. Oh, no. Really, no. lt's just OK, you're the only person that l've been with in a long time. l mean, not unusually long or anything, you know? Just a normal amount of long time. But it wouldn't matter to me if you've been with someone else. Maybe you have? l'm not accusing you of anything or, you know, judging you or handing out scarlet letters or anything, you know? You're a woman, you know? A very attractive woman. Of course you've been with other men. Not that you've been with a lot of men, like you're a prostitute - A prostitute? - No! Not a Not a prostitute. Wha? No, the opposite of a prostitute, a lady. You're very ladylike. l mean, you're very bendy, but - George, breathe. - OK. lt's just OK, here's the thing. l really like you, Olivia. l like you a lot. Well, l like you too. l have syphilis. That could have gone better. [knocking on door] You dropped a retractor. Fine. A few weeks ago, l was operating, and the vision in my right eye became blurry. After a few hours, it was fine. lt's come back again. - Did you have it checked out? - The examination was normal. My ophthalmologist tells me l'm just getting older. But you know what a decline in my visual acuity can mean. l'll set up some tests. Shep, l know how the rumor mill runs around here. Let's just keep this to ourselves. Absolutely. Yeah. [George] Do you think she's talking about me? She's absolutely talking about you. [Alex] Dude, that's a good thing. [George] No. No, it's not. Georgie, get a clue. Syphilis is the best thing that ever happened to you. ln their eyes, you're a player. [Cristina] Hey, syph-boy. You told her? Just Cristina. [Alex] ''Syph-boy.'' lt's got a nice ring to it, kind of like Superboy, only diseased. [Cristina] lzzie didn't say a word. Here, the only thing that spreads faster than disease is gossip. That's not true. Just 'cause lzzie can't keep her mouth shut doesn't mean everyone knows. How are you feeling? Sorry about the syphilis. Everyone in this hospital knows? Knows you're a player. - You're disturbed. - True. Everybody's got a secret. Be glad yours is out in the open. Oh, yeah, Alex? What's yours? You show me yours, and l'll show you mine. l bet you've got some seriously kinky skeletons in your closet. What's in my closet is none of your business. Well, l don't have any secrets. My life is boring. Everybody's got something to hide. Well, the mass we found is not a tumor. Well, that's good, right? Anything's got to be better than cancer. That's where it gets a little tricky. The chromosomal tests have revealed that your body contains DNA from two different embryos that merged in the womb at the very beginning of development. ln rare cases such as yours, the condition can produce gonadal hermaphroditism. l'm hearing scary words here, Preston, you know, pay-cable kind of words. ln English, the mass in your bladder is an ovary. Huh? Don't worry. We're gonna remove it. We have an excellent gynecological surgeon on staff. You're telling me l'm a guy with an ovary? lt's simply a quirk of nature, man. [exhaling] What am l gonna tell Holly? That you're gonna be fine. l'm still a man, right? A man's man, a Kappa man. l mean you know, my sex life. You been having any problems? [laughs] Was it my very pregnant wife that gave it away? [both laughing] Come on, man, don't worry. You never knew it was there. You won't miss it when it's gone. Are you sure you know what you're doing? lt's a shot of penicillin, George. Be grateful l'm even doing this. l've seen more of you than l ever wanted. l'll be fighting nightmares for a week. Know what? Forget this. Do you want to get rid of the syph or not? Just shut up and drop 'em. l cannot believe this. Meredith, go away! Oh, George. Thought you could use some moral support. No. No moral support. l'm indisposed here. George, it's not a big deal. And you have a cute butt. [Alex] l have a cute butt too. You want to see? Oh, get out. You're doing it wrong. - Be my guest. - What? Alex. Alex. Wha? Hey! [lzzie] What are we doing here? Breaking George's spirit. - Curing George's syph. - l don't like needles. [Meredith] Good thing you became a doctor. Other side. - [Cristina] lzzie? - Yeah? Mr. Franklin's procedure's been scheduled for after lunch Oh, what are we doing? We're saving George from a future of festering sores and insanity. - Oh, cute butt. - Told you. lt is cute, like a baby's. You know, l have spent hours, days, years, imagining myself half-naked in a room with three women. The reality is so much better. l think he's gonna cry. [all laughing] Hi. It's Ms. Henry again. - ls this a better time? - Sorry about this morning. l wasn't alone and What were you calling about? I just wanted to remind you that tonight's our monthly family dinner. You know, you haven't been to any of our family functions. You have to understand. l'm a surgical intern, so my time isn't my own. Our residents really respond to these events. They always enjoy themselves, which is so rare. I think it's important you attend. l'll be there. l'll try to be there. l'll definitely try. l've cleared some time for your MRl. Good. Let's get going. OK. Uh, sorry to bother you with this, chief. We've got kind of a situation. What now? Three interns, four residents and six nurses on this surgical floor have been diagnosed with syphilis. [woman] There are over Undiagnosed, syphilis can lead to blindness, insanity and death. lf you are having unprotected sex with another member of the staff, get tested. This is not a request. [all laughing] [sighing] Patricia will now give you a safe-sex demonstration. [laughing continues] When the time is right, and, gentlemen, you'll all know when that time is, carefully open the condom packet and roll it onto the banana. We should try and get down to do the MRl now. This isn't really a good time. lf you want to do this without anybody else knowing, you should do it now. [Patricia] Open communication is essential to a healthy relationship. ln a responsible relationship - [Meredith] Poor George. - [Cristina] Yeah. You know, l think he really likes Typhoid Mary. Well, not many budding relationships survive a good dose of VD. Yeah. [Patricia] When the banana is finished Yeah. gently peel off the condom and dispose of it properly. With every fresh banana, always use a fresh condom. [laughter] [? Nellie McKay : The Dog Song] [elevator dings] [sighing] You're avoiding me. l'm busy, at work. l-l'm working. Why are you in this line? lt's the syphilis line. You don't need to be in this line. l don't? There's no one else. That surprises you? Nothing surprises me. Do l need to be in this line? No. - OK. - OK. - Hey. - Oh, hey. - Mr. Franklin is prepped and ready. - Excellent. God, look at this line. Well, at least we don't have to stand in line. That's the one good thing about the fact - neither of us is getting any, right? - Yeah. Mr. Franklin, we've given you a local anesthetic, but you might feel some pressure. OK. l'm ready. - Grab the skin. - OK. l'm in the peritoneal cavity. That fluid is bloody. ls it supposed to be bloody? You've done this before, right? Of course. Millions of times. You're doing great, Mr. Franklin. OK. Wait, wait. OK, go. [Cristina] Good. [sighing] Now all we have to do is wait. - You see that right there? - Mm-hmm. it's a tumor, and it's pressing against your optic nerve. ls it operable? Oh, definitely. lt does have its risks. You mean l could lose my sight? Just what l need, a syphilis outbreak and a tumor. lt's probably unrelated. All right, Derek, let's see how good you really are. All right. l'll put a team together. All my people only. And l still want this kept under wraps. The vultures will be circling soon enough. Aren't l one of the vultures? Why do you think l want to keep an eye on you? Get going. We're doing this tonight. Right. [clearing throat] [Meredith] You paged. Yeah, l need you to help me out on something for the chief. - Can you keep a secret? - Better than you think. How much fluid can one body hold? Shh! There's a lot of fluid in there, Mr. Franklin, but we're almost finished. [sighing] Mr. Franklin, are you sleeping? Mr. Franklin? - He has no pulse. - What? [lzzie] He has no pulse! [woman over PA] Code blue. Code blue. How could he die like that with no warning? There was blood when it first went in. What if it's our fault? What if we did something wrong? We didn't do anything wrong. We did a textbook procedure. [clearing throat] l checked your chart. You did everything by the book. He died on our watch. We must have missed something. There was no history of heart problems. His death wasn't your fault. When's the autopsy? There isn't gonna be an autopsy. What? How are we supposed to know the cause of death? lt's going down as cardiopulmonary arrest complicated by liver disease. But an autopsy would The family decided they didn't want an autopsy. - But, Dr. Bailey - They don't want an autopsy. Let it go. [woman over PA] Dr. Burke to Cardiology. Dr. Burke to Cardiology. How goes our special super secret silent sunset surgery? l've been practicing that. You have too much time on your hands. Uh, tell the chief l'll be there. Just let me know when and where. l'm in. [Meredith] OK. [laughing] - Are you nervous? - lt's a complicated surgery. l make one mistake, l end a fellow surgeon's career, my mentor's career. Oh, no, l'm not nervous. - So just for the record - Mm-hm. you'd tell me if l need to get tested, right? - You think l have syphilis? - No, l don't. lt's just We never made any rules or anything. l mean, we never said, ''We have rules,'' and l wouldn't hold it against you. When would l have time to go out and get syphilis? You're a handful enough as it is, and besides, we're, like, practically a condom ad. But no more glow-in-the-dark ones. You see? There's nothing to worry about. Maybe we should, you know, make some rules, l mean. We should. - OK. - OK. - Just for the record - Uh-huh? l like the glow-in-the-dark ones. [laughing] l bet you do. [cell phone ringing] [woman] That's the last of the ovarian material. l just need to sew up the perforation on the bladder wall. - Uh - [Burke] ls there a problem, Dr. Knox? Well, you said this man's wife is pregnant? Due in five weeks. Why? Our patient has a blind vas deferens. Bill is sterile? And always has been. Then who got his wife pregnant? - Oh. - Oh. [Alex] Sucks to be Bill right now. How's Burke gonna tell him the baby's not his? - Burke's not gonna tell. - He has to. Bill's better off not knowing. You think Holly knows Bill's not the father? - Maybe, maybe not. - Bill should know his wife's cheating. l don't remember asking for your opinions, so keep them to yourselves. Sorry, sir. You're such a gossip. [? lron & Wine: Naked as We Came] [lzzie] We know how confusing this must be, your husband dying so suddenly. But an autopsy will tell us why. So you think we should do the autopsy? [Alice] No, we want this to be over. But don't you want to know for certain what killed him? My father was a mean drunk who couldn't hold a job. That's what killed him. l understand that you're angry. But knowing for sure might help give you some closure. lt was awfully sudden, Alice. Sudden? He's been killing himself for years. He was a good man. Maybe maybe they're right. Maybe we should do the autopsy. Mom, stop it. He's dead. lt's finally over. Alice, your father would have wanted Who cares what he wanted? Can't we please just try and get out of this with whatever shred of dignity this family has left? [sighing] [sniffing] You guys want to perform an unauthorized autopsy? l know you, Cristina. You do not want to be known as the new 007. An autopsy clears your name. - Cristina, no. - What about Franklin's wife? You saw the way she was looking at me. She wants the autopsy. She didn't want to fight with her daughter. She looked so sad. OK, Cristina Yang, license to kill. OK, l'm in. l am so not involved in this. Meredith, this is Fight Club. Nobody talks about it. Fine. We have to do it when Bailey's not around. She's everywhere and knows everything. We have to take our chances. Bailey's got something tonight from 7 to 1 1 . You'll be the last thing she's worried about. - How do you know that? - What kind of something? Oh, l can't tell you that. lt's Fight Club too. lf l'm missing out on a real patient because of this, they're gonna call me 007 because l've killed you. - How we doing? - Did you lock up the gallery? Don't worry. We're flying under the radar. What did you put out there, the Midas Rex? We've got it, chief. How much vancomycin is there? One gram, as ordered, sir. Not gonna be too liberal with those benzos? You know, doctors make the worst patients. You should just breathe in the happy gas. Stop running my OR. l got you covered. We stole a body. We're body snatchers. What if somebody from the morgue comes looking for Franklin? Well, A, it's in the middle of the night, and, B, the thing about being dead is people stop looking for you. OK. [clearing throat] When did you last do an autopsy? l took gross anatomy like you. l'm just trying to remember. You know what? Hold on. Hold on. Wait. Hold on. You brought a textbook? Uh, if we're gonna do this, we're gonna do it right. OK. - OK, got it. - You sure? lt's not like we can kill him twice. Let me cut. You'll get your turn. - You should be using the ten-blade. - Will you stop backseat cutting? Go get the saw. OK, l've sutured the drain in place. The staples look fine. All right, we're done here. Dr. Bailey, you want to wrap him? Nice work, everybody. Nicely done. - Thanks. - Good. Do you think the optic nerve is damaged? lf it is, when he wakes up, he'll He'll be blind? For how long? Forever. [Bailey] Page Stevens and Yang. Tell them l want them covering your patients. l need you to stay and monitor the chief. Cristina and lzzie, um l think they're already swamped. With what? Labs. They had to check on some labs. Oh, you are lying. l know you're lying. You know how l know? 'Cause you're a bad liar! l hate a bad liar. Take over for me. l know exactly where they are. Here. Take over for me. [sighing] [Burke] Your whole relationship is a lie. We're happy. We've wanted a child for a long time. Why do you want to take this away from him? Does he know you've been cheating on him? This is between Bill and me. The man has a right to know that this isn't his child. Please, just let this go. Why can't you let this go? Bill is my best friend. That's why. lf you were his friend, you wouldn't do this. Please! Tell him the truth! Why? l'm not gonna ruin my life, because you think this is wrong. Your life? What about his life? What about this child's life? What Bill doesn't know won't hurt him. Fine. Maybe his friend wouldn't tell him the truth. But l'm also his doctor, and his doctor is not going to lie to him. [Meredith] l know, but something came up, an important surgery, and l couldn't. Sorry you couldn't be there for your mother. Ms. Henry, if my mother were lucid, she would understand. She's a surgeon. She's done this countless times. And besides, she doesn't even know who l am, anyway, so [Henry] Today she did. What? Your mother's been asking when her daughter Meredith gets off from work. Hey. [cell phone closing] Hey. A lot of secret phone calls today. Yeah, it's my mother. She isn't traveling. She isn't writing a book. She isn't anything. l've been lying to everyone. Why? She has Alzheimer's. How advanced? [Meredith] Very. She's in a home, and l'm the only one who even knows she's sick. l just don't know what to do anymore, you know? [monitor beeping] Don't even tell me you're doing what l think you're doing! Um Not only did you disregard the family's wishes, you broke the law! You could be arrested for assault! Do you like jail? The hospital could be sued! l could lose my license, my job! l like my job! Did you think about any of this before you started cutting open a poor man's body? l could seriously kick both of your asses right now. [Bailey] Do you have anything to say? Look at his heart. lt's huge! lt's over 600 grams, and there's some kind of grainy material in it. - We want to run some tests. - Oh, now you want to run tests? At this point, what could it hurt? l hate both of you right now. [monitor beeping] Meredith? He's an attending. You're an intern. You saw us? You can see. l'm gonna tell you what your mother would say if she were here. You're making a mistake, a big one. And l would tell my mother it's not a mistake. We specifically said no autopsy. l understand why you're upset. [Alice] You understand? We're gonna get an attorney. [Alice] Come on, Mom. We know what killed him. [Cristina] He had a blood condition known as hemachromatosis. The disease causes an excess amount of iron to build up in the body, and that's what caused the heart failure, not the paracentesis. But l thought he was always so sick 'cause of the drinking. And you never let him forget it. - Or me. - Mom There's something else. The disease is genetic. - You think Alice could have it? - A blood test will tell us. lf you have it, we'll have caught it to treat it, before the condition becomes critical. [Bailey] Dr. Stevens and Dr. Yang may have saved your life. lf you could just sign this consent form for the autopsy. [Bailey] Just a formality. [? The Radio: Whatever Gets You Through Today] [Meredith] The thing people forget is how good it can feel when you finally set secrets free. Whether good or bad, at least they're out in the open, like it or not. Um, about before George, l want you to understand, when we started dating, l was already kind of seeing someone. l didn't know how much l'd like you, and when l realized, l broke it off with the other guy Other guy? Who's the other guy? You and Alex? You and Alex?! You gave me syphilis?! - George! - George! George, back off! [Meredith] Alex! [Cristina] George! Back off, Alex. [Meredith] Once your secrets are out in the open, you don't have to hide behind them anymore. [Derek] Long day. Yeah. Somewhere out there is a steak with your name on it and maybe a bottle of wine. This is why l keep you around. So we need to talk. Wine first, talk later. You trying to, uh, get me drunk so you can take advantage of me? [laughing] l think l like this rules thing. Me too. Meredith, l am so sorry. [Meredith] The problem with secrets is even when you think you're in control Addison. you're not. What are you doing here? You'd know if you'd bothered to return any one of my phone calls. Hi. l'm Addison Shepherd. Shepherd? And you must be the woman who's been screwing my husband.

                    			[Meredith] You know how when you were a kid and you believed in fairy tales? [? Nellie McKay: David] That fantasy of what your life would be. White dress, Prince Charming, who'd carry you away to a castle on a hill. You'd lie in bed at night and close your eyes, and you had complete and utter faith. [sighs] Eight hours, 1 6 ounces of chocolate and 32 cupcakes, and they still don't taste right. No, these are good. Martha Stewart would be proud. Yeah, look where it got her. [Meredith] Santa Claus, the Tooth Fairy, Prince Charming, they were so close, you taste them. There's something missing, some specific ingredient. Why can't l remember? But eventually, you grow up. One day you open your eyes, and the fairy tale disappears. Look, just call her. Call your mother and ask. Most people turn to the things and people they can trust. l don't want to call my mother. So let's go sleep at your house tonight. What? Why are we always sleeping at my house? - Do you even have one? - One what? A house. With a closet. With your stuff in it. Your personal stuff. Do you even have one of those? Mmm. Good morning. - [George] Hey. You guys want a cupcake? - Oh, no. lzzie made them. l like it here. You said yourself, you liked having your things around, sleeping in your own bed. You're like a health nut. You eat muesli every morning. No, l don't. OK, the muesli thing, you do. The last seven days, at least. Oh, come on. l haven't been here for a whole week. - Have l? - See? Even they think it's weird. [Meredith] But the thing is, it's hard to let go of that fairy tale entirely. Almost everyone still has that smallest bit of hope, of faith, that one day they'll open their eyes and it will all come true. [door opens] So l've checked the schedule. l start ENT On the 9th. lt's a light rotation. Can you get me in then? Oh, l'm afraid not. We have openings on the 1 6th. There are other options besides termination, you know? Adoption, keeping the baby. You think it over. Call me back. - l'm here - Put me down for the 1 6th. l'll confirm after l rearrange my schedule. l know this is a difficult decision. - You know the talking part? - Mm. l'm not interested. So, Devo, you just had a root canal, correct? Yeah. l couldn't stop bleeding after, literally. Now l'm stuck with you guys. Give me the bullet. for excessive bleeding, post root canal. Also a significant new heart murmur associated with fever. Now afebrile on antibiotics. lf l'm gonna die, page my mom and dad? You're not dying. Where are your parents? ln the cafeteria. My freak father likes hospital food. [Burke] You're in excellent hands. Dr. Karev is gonna run some labs. And l'll see you with your parents in a little while. Add a bleeding time to the coags. So, what kind of name is Devo, anyway? '80s rocker. My parents did too much blow. l call myself Esther. Nice skirt. What are you, Amish? Get a life. Haven't you ever seen an Orthodox Jew? This guy belongs in Psych. What are you doing turfing him here? My gift to you. Had a seizure two days ago and another one this morning. What are you talking about? lt says, ''He talks to dead people, family thinks he's dangerous. They had him committed.'' That's Psych, not Neuro. Didn't you go to med school? Yes, unlike the correspondence school you attended - Oh, that would be Stanford, right? - l learned not to jump to conclusions. Sorry, ladies. We can't take him back until he's cleared. You're dumping him on us? He thinks his seizures are visions. Hello! They're not seizures. l'm psychic. [Cristina] Of course you are, and l'm a chicken. Hey, genius. OK, Mr. Duff. We're gonna start our workup now. Work me up, work me down, waste of time. Well, humor us. Can you grip my fingers, please? Cristina. Mr. Duff? Mr. Duff, are you OK? [breathes deeply] Someone Someone what? Someone's gonna check out. Bye-bye. Oh, man, he's nuts. l'm dizzy, not deaf, lady. Someone on the fourth floor is gonna die. [man over PA] Code blue, fourth floor. Code blue, fourth floor. [man] Got a code. [woman] Right away. [man] Go get it. [beeping] [? Psapp: Nobody Knows] Fourth floor, dead guy. The psychic predicted the fourth floor dead guy. l need someone to cover me on the 1 6th. You in? l'm thinking about letting my hair grow. And maybe l won't shave. Go for the stubble effect. What do you think? The 1 6th, George. Can you cover me or not? Uh, yeah. l guess. Why? lt's none of your business. A thank-you would be nice. lt's just that l hardly know anything about you. l'm from New York. l like ferry boats. Enough with the ferry boats. What about your friends? - l'm a surgeon. l don't have friends. - Everybody has friends. l mean, who do you hang out with? What do you do on your days off? These are important questions. Ah, important for who? We're having sex every night. l think l deserve details. - You have more details than most. - This is going somewhere weird. l want facts, and until l get them, my pants are staying on. Or you could just roll with it. Be flexible. See what happens. l'm not flexible. - [pager beeps] - There l disagree. Hmm. l've got to go. [exhales deeply] We'll find these things out. That's the fun part. That's the gravy. That is what l'm talking about. l don't want to be your gravy. [sighs] Your daughter needs a valve replacement. Tests indicate von Willebrand's disease, which explains excessive bleeding after the root canal. And that means? Devo can't take the blood thinners to maintain a mechanical heart valve. We're suggesting a porcine valve instead. Porcine? As in pig? lt's the standard of care for someone in this situation. Pig, huh? lt's the other white meat. l don't care what you have to do. Save my daughter's life. [woman over PA] Dr. Jennings to OR 7. Dr. Jennings to OR 7. [monitor beeping] l'm removing the lump now. Someone said you guys have a psychic running around. ls that true? l did not even hear you say that. Predicted someone would die on the fourth floor. lCU's on the fourth floor. People die all the time. We're finishing up here, Mrs. Glass. We'll take this down to Path and get the results of the frozen-section biopsy and see you in a few hours. The guy is just playing mind games. l can see further into the future than he can. Why do you care about this, Stevens? l don't. OK, Mr. Walker. Does that hurt? l can't feel anything until you get to my thigh. Try wiggling your toes. Are they moving? - No. - Damn. l could about ten minutes ago. Well, your spine x-rays look clear. You fell rock climbing? ln Snohomish. Just a small drop. l was belayed. My wife and boys are on the way. What's wrong with me, anyway? Hold your legs up. - Should l be scared now? - Just try and relax. Nurse, l need a stat MRl. Send an intern with him. Make it Meredith Grey. Mm-hmm. [Karev] Ew. Thick, short neck. That isn't good. lt's hard to intubate. - You want me to do that? - He's my patient. l'm fine. l just can't see anything yet. Suction. Don't break any teeth. l know Don't you think l know? Pulse ox down 87 percent. Bag him. Sure you don't want me to do that? No, damn it! Tube. [rapid beeping] [grunting] There. Huh. Got it. lt's in the esophagus. Don't you know an esophagus from a trachea? [George] Anatomy is messed up in here. You trying to kill this patient, O'Malley? Maybe we can send you to practice on mannequins. No, it's just l haven't done this much. But when l have, it's it's been good. lt's just l-l haven't Let's review the concepts. Never take your eyes away. Always, always know you can follow through. Don't ever follow through on one of my patients, O'Malley. Botox would do wonders for all those frown lines. OK. Shut up. You allowed to talk to me like that? [hisses] God, you're hot in a Mrs. Livingston kind of way. See here? These are spikes in your temporal lobe. lt means you have epilepsy. Not visions. Seizures. You think l'm epileptic? That is so not right. l'm gonna order an MRl so l can take a closer look at your brain. Yeah, there's no way Mr. Duff? Mr. Duff, can you see me? Can you hear me? Stay with me. l wouldn't have picked you for the mommy track, Nurse Betty. See? l told you l know things. This pregnancy thing, you can't run away from it. Dr. Bailey, l want off the psychic case. l'll take whatever you got. Can l switch? Ask nicely. Uh, well, this is me doing nicely. Look, l know the type. These guys want everybody to think they're a sideshow. - Let me take him. - l don't do switches. l'll do your post-op notes for a month. Fine. l can accept that. lzzie, you get Psych guy. Yang. This is your lucky day. You get to be with me on breast cancer. There's spotting. You'll need to do a pelvic. She's pregnant. See? This. The guy's films are clear. There's no reason l can see for his creeping paralysis. lt's just so surprising. l expected an intrusion into the spinal space or bony spur in the pulposus. Well, you were wrong. You don't always get what you expect, do you? What is your problem? Give me something to go on. Anything. What are your grandparents' names? - l don't have them. - Where'd you grow up? Your favorite flavor of ice cream? Where'd you spend your summer vacations? Lighten up. Oh, don't you tell me to lighten up. l'll lighten up when l feel light. Don't we have treatment options? l-l mean, aren't there always alternatives? With this stage of invasive carcinoma, surgery, chemo, radiation and drug therapy are your only options. Can l wait until the end of my pregnancy? The pregnancy hormones will likely speed the growth of the cancer. And the baby? None of these treatments will allow the baby to survive. Mr. and Mrs. Glass, l understand how difficult this is. No disrespect, but like hell, you do. You're going to have to make a decision as to how you want to proceed. You mean my baby's life or my own? Yes. We'll have to evacuate the fetus. [exhales] [Derek] Any changes, Mr. Walker? [Mr. Walker] l can't move my legs at all. He was moving his legs when he came in. - What's wrong with him? - l don't know. The paralysis is moving quickly, and nothing in the MRl to explain it. - Has Tommy been under stress lately? - You know what's making me stressed? Being in here and not being able to move. Dr. Grey. Emotional trauma can be converted - into something physical? - Possible. Like hysterical numbness or paralysis. Maybe there is no physiological reason, and he's having a conversion reaction. - lt's psychosomatic? - lt is not in your head, man. - l believe you. - [lzzie] Mr. Duff, please. Who was that? Psych sent him down. He has visions. ls that it? Am l crazy? No. No. l'm gonna order a higher-level MRl. We're gonna figure this out. You know how important this is to me! This is about saving your life. You're not respecting it, or me. You're letting them put a pig, a freaking non-kosher, traif mammal, into my chest, into my heart! The very essence of my being! lt's a porcine valve, actually. l don't care what it is. lf you give me a pig part, l might as well be dead. [man] This Orthodox thing was a mistake. What was wrong with being Reform like everyone else? You guys don't even light candles Friday nights. You don't know all the Passover plagues. Boils, vermin, pestilence. Even l know that. Miss Friedman, l appreciate your extreme religious convictions. Fire, hail Simply put, without this procedure, you will die. You're hotshot doctors. You'll come up with something else. As long as it doesn't answer to Wilbur and say ''oink,'' l don't care what it is. Your nostrils are flaring. They are not. You're into me. l can tell. ''Dr. Small and Angry'' was a hot appetizer, but you, doc, are a smorgasbord of lust. Mr. Duff, you're pressing your luck. Would you press it for me? l hope you're not claustrophobic. You're staring at me. Stop it. l'm looking at you, sweetheart, but it's the strangest thing. l'm hungry for a chocolate cupcake. - What did you say? - A chocolate cupcake. One of those fudgey things with the white squiggle on the frosting. Could you oblige? What, do l still have some chocolate on my face or in my hair or something? - What are you talking about? - You. l know the drill, so keep it up. Next you'll be reading my cards, telling me my dead uncle is in the room. - ls he? - l don't have a dead uncle. l'm watching you. [sniffs] [whistling] - lf that's turkey, can l have some? - lt's soggy. - lt'll kill you. Solve everything. - l am good at intubations. Why does everything in a hospital smell like a hospital? Don't be so hard on yourself. Everybody makes mistakes. l'm good at a lot of things. l'm gonna tell you something. You need to get laid. See that nurse over there? She's single. She's got red hair. Go ask her out. - l intubated an esophagus. - Dude, you're tweaking. - Maybe you should go see that psychic. - Mr. Duff is not a psychic! l am trying to help you. Go buy her a latte and freshen up your gonad, please. Shut up. lt's not too late to call her. You know, moms like that, surprises on their birthdays. You know, it's very Hallmark. l'm 47, you know? l'm 47 and having a baby, which is kind of a miracle, and it kind of sucks, if you see what l mean. [sighs] We'd given up on the kid thing about a year ago. You know, fertility treatments, acupuncture needles in my eyes. Well, not really, but it felt like it. lt was like, ''Screw this. l want my life back.'' Then one awesome night on the beach with a bottle of merlot l should have these labs back in a couple hours. You get it, right? My hesitation? This isn't an easy decision, l mean. l'm having a baby. You have advanced-stage carcinoma. You're 47 years old, so statistically you have a good probability of survival. Forego treatment, chances are you won't see your baby go to kindergarten, so whose life are you interested in saving? Excuse me. [Mr. Walker] First my legs, then stomach. God. Doc! Doc, my hands can't move. - Squeeze my fingers. - l can't. Right here. No? Let me know if you feel this. How about that? Here? Anything here? Up here? OK. Nothing on this side? All right. l'll be right back. Nurse, cancel the second MRl. Call down and prep OR stat. You're operating? On what? lf there was something to fix, wouldn't we see it? The MRl missed a clot in his upper spine. l'm gonna cut him open. l'm going in. What if you're wrong? Couldn't unnecessary spinal surgery do damage? lf we wait longer and this expands we have a paralyzed man who can't breathe. l'm trusting my instincts. Sometimes you've got to take a chance to save a life. [? Laura Veirs: Rapture] Your mitral regurge is getting worse. The valves are leakier than ever. Are you hitting on me? lf you want me to. l hear they call you Dr. Evilspawn. Well, only the people that like me. l guess that explains the lack of faith thing. You know, l kind of think of myself as a pagan, but, hey, that's just me. You know what it's like being a teenager these days? My friends spend most of their time screwing around and getting wasted. At least l have God. Well, so God wants you to die, huh? He wants me to be passionate about what l believe in. You don't believe in anything. [exhales] My mother used to pray to Saint Jude for me. How appropriate. Patron saint of lost causes. [laughs] Mmm. l did an angio on my Psych case. The MRl came out clean, but l saw a ditzel. There's something here. Yep, you're right. There's an AVM on his left temporal lobe. - l'll schedule the OR for tonight. - Ohh, back up, girl. There's high risk of spontaneous hemorrhage. The attending has to see films. We need consent forms. Believe it or not, Stevens, we have to follow protocol. But if the AVM looks like it's gonna blow, we fix it, right? lf the man needs to be fixed, we'll fix him in time. Why are you moving so quickly? You get too involved with your patients, lzzie. Why do you make everything so personal? lt's not personal. lt's not. Pulse ox, 98. We've got to save this cord. This guy's built like the Rock of Gibraltar. You want me to start? l'm going to cut here from the base of the neck to the rib cage. l want you to hit the bleeders. l still don't think we should be doing this. - Spinal hematoma. - We don't know. Left untreated are almost always fatal. You're cutting blind. Whatever happened to being practical? l need to see more here. Retractor. Wow. The spine. There's no ''wow'' in ''practical.'' We have decided to go ahead with the evacuation. What the hell, right? Maybe this is how it's supposed to be. We need to start chemo right away. We'll get everything ready. Have you ever done a D and C before? We learned at school. OK, uh, go ahead. l'll call an OB resident down to supervise. lf she needs anything, page me. [woman] Dr. Grimm to ICU stat. Dr. Grimm to ICU stat. You're using up my oxygen, O'Malley. How does a pompous, cocky jackass like you always have women all over him? Little blue love pills, lots of them. - Come on. - [sighs] Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee. There it is, a bovine xenograft. [laughs] O'Malley, you think too much. Can't you see it? You got to dance and jab. Dance and jab. Like me. l am the Ali of this place. [praying in Hebrew] [Karev clears throat] Does the wall ever bow back? lt's called davening, smartass. This is me communing with God, and you're interrupting. l've found a transplant option. At first, l thought maybe a cadaver, but they're really hard to find. And then l realized Dr. Burke can transplant a bovine mitral valve instead of the pig. She can get a cow valve? - Why wasn't this mentioned before? - Dr. Karev. The bovine valve has only been an option the last few years. lt's a much more complicated procedure. But the best part is it's superior to the pig. lt lasts longer. What small fraction of your brain were you using? - What? - Correct me if wrong, but did you not present an alternative without consulting your attending first? - l thought you'd be - lmpressed? That's just stupid. - Sorry - We're finished here, Karev. You're off this case. You need to sign these consent forms so we can proceed with your surgery. l'm not signing anything unless it's got my name followed by a whole bunch of zeros. Look, the AVM is located in this crucial part of the brain. A tangle of blood vessels that could burst and affect speech, among other things. - We know your visions are seizures. - Do you? - Do l what? - Know they're seizures. You're really good at reading people, aren't you? Telling them what they want to hear? There's an unfortunate alignment of Saturn in the house of Jupiter now. OK. l know what you're doing. You watch people, read their body language. Say ''chocolate cupcakes,'' l lean towards you, so you think you're on the right track. You know you're having seizures, you're milking it. Hmm. Well, we'll just see about that, cricket. What? What did you just call me? [laughs] [telephone rings] l'm gonna do a quick pelvic exam. The OB resident should be down soon. lt's a short procedure. Your husband can stay if he likes. - We changed our minds. - Excuse me? We've decided to keep the baby. You have cancer. Can you tell me l'll survive if l go through with this? Having the procedure does not necessarily improve the outcome. You have quite the bedside manner. You know that? My mom died of breast cancer when she was in her 40s. l have that cancer gene. My chances are pretty much lose-lose, whichever way you look at it, except for the baby. We're keeping it. l'll call down a Psych consult. Don't bother. l am going to get fat and happy instead of skinny and bald. - l'm at the end - lf you want to live Honey, that's what l'm doing. Look, if you think you're gonna get any, think again. l'm not in the mood. - l'm not in the mood, either. - Good. What do you want? Nothing. l just haven't seen you all day. So l'm working. l've never done a bovine replacement before. l don't know what l'm doing. Look it up, research it and get someone to assist you. [scoffs] lt's not that easy. This is a problem that has a solution, Burke. There are a lot of problems that don't. [monitor beeping] Third thoracic laminae. Nothing. l think l see the dura pulsating here. - No, it's not. Keep looking. - We have been at this for four hours. Maybe he just injured his spinal cord, and there's nothing to fix. Grey, when you read your books, make sure you reference them correctly. Progressive paralysis implies a pressure lesion. My books got me here [beeping] Pressure's up to 1 80l1 1 1 . The pulse is in the 40s. What is it? l'm pushing 70 milligrams Diazoxide. - Autonomic dysreflexia. - Damage to the nervous system? BP and the heart rate are unstable. - We're in trouble? - We've got to find the clot. l can see the cord below the dura. Focus, Grey. We're gonna find the clot. lt's there. Cleanup, please. BP's still up. Heart rate's at 44. Get on those bleeders. Keep looking, Dr. Grey. [sighs] Dr. O'Malley? Our patient's pulse ox is dropping. She's agonal. She needs to be intubated. ls there anyone else who can do this? - You're here. l could find someone. - No, that's l got it. OK. - Sats down to 86 percent. - Cric pressure, please. OK. l see cords. Tube. Hurry. Check for breath sounds. Clear and equal. CO2 detector mellow yellow. Smooth moves, doctor. Kicked ass. [laughs] Oh, Dr. Karev. How long would it take to get a cow valve? Oh, about 60 minutes by messenger. You're scrubbing in. Thank you very much, sir. This doesn't get you any points, Karev. l'm the only one with points around here, OK? Oh, by the way, Devo wants a rabbi to bless her before surgery. - Seriously? - You came up with the cow, you can find that girl a rabbi. [man] lrrigation and suction, have it ready. [woman] Right away. What is it? See for yourself. The second thoracic vertebrae. [Meredith] Oh, my God. - l see it. lt really is there. - Of course it is. Let's suction and pack this baby, shall we? [woman] Suction. Here you go. [woman] Dr. Burke to Oncology. You were right. - ls he gonna be OK? - l think so. But you don't know that. We stopped the paralysis from advancing. You don't know if the paralysis he already has will be permanent. No. You keep taking everything on faith. How do you know what's real and what's not? You just do. Some people would call this a relationship. The kind where you exchange keys, leave your toothbrush over. Who? Who would call it that? Me. l would. - l'm supposed to believe you? - Uh-huh. - Show me something. - [sighs] Give me a reason to believe. [? 78 Saab: No Illusions] l have your discharge papers. Oh, you're not happy with me, are you? l'm your doctor. lt's not my place to be happy. My husband and child are going to be together long after l'm gone. We've talked about it. lt's our decision, and that's OK. - So why do you need my approval? - l just want you to understand. Well, l don't. [thunder rumbles] [knocking on door] l brought the consent forms again. You really need to sign them. Your surgeon scheduled the OR. Mr. Duff, are you all right? Are you having another seizure? Yeah. Yeah. [clears throat] l think maybe l am. What is it? lt's me. l think it's about to be over. We know what we're doing, Mr. Duff. You saw the angio results. We're catching the AVM just in time. You don't need to be nervous. You're not gonna die. l'm not talking about dying. My whole life has been about what l see and about believing in myself, whatever people think. You're telling me there's a chance that will go away. Look, you're a healthy guy. You're gonna live a long, full life. lf your psychic visions are real, you've got to believe you'll have them when you come out. [thunder rumbles] [woman praying in Hebrew] [doctor] She's good. This is Dr. Chesney from the Cleveland Clinic. He's an expert on bovine valve replacement surgery. He will be assisting via satellite. Thank you, doctor. After the sternotomy and connection to bypass, we're going to do a transverse left atriotomy to expose the valve. [inhales] l tried to talk Shepherd out of that clot surgery. What is wrong with me? - Basically, you tried to kill the guy. - Basically, you're an ass. You know you want it. Come to papi, baby. This, uh, is George. George has a hot date. [laughing] Oh, that's great, George. Yeah. Left pocket of my lab coat, Georgie. No glove, no love. [sighs] My psychic had his surgery. Yeah? l wonder what happened with his gift. Come on. We all know he's crazy. You said you didn't believe in that. l grew up in a trailer park. l waited tables, which was supposed to put me through college, but my mother was always calling these psychics all the time. The bills started piling up, so l had to use my money to pay them. When l turned 1 8, l left and never went back. But this guy has been saying things to me, things he couldn't possibly know anything about. So l just wonder. Do you have sensation anywhere else? Some feeling in my stomach and feet, l guess. - Bladder and bowels? - Not so good still. The pressure stockings help relieve clots and bedsores? [Grey] They do. l wanted to thank you for everything. Believing in me, that l wasn't making it up. Well, l'll come back tomorrow, then. [Mr. Walker] l wanted to show you something. l wasn't sure it would last, but now look. l know it's hardly anything, but No, it's something. lt's something really big. [? Tegan and Sara: Fix You Up] [Meredith] At the end of the day, faith is a funny thing. It turns up when you don't really expect it. Mr. Duff, you're still with us. For your recipe one tablespoon coconut extract. [Meredith] It's like one day you realize that the fairy tale may be slightly different than you dreamed. [car alarm beeping] Where are we going? Trust me. [Meredith] The castle, well it may not be a castle. Does it beat or moo? And it's not so important that it's happy ever after. Just that it's happy right now. [ringing] Mom. lt's me. Cricket. [Meredith] See, once in a while, once in a blue moon, people will surprise you. l've been thinking about you a lot too. Where are we? Shh, shh. l'm gonna tell you. All right. My mother's maiden name, Maloney. l have four sisters. l have, uh, nine nieces. Five nephews. l like coffee ice cream, single-malt scotch, occasionally a good cigar. l like to fly-fish. l cheat when l do the crossword puzzle on Sunday. And l never dance in public. Um, favorite novel, The Sun Also Rises. Favorite band, The Clash. My favorite color is blue. l don't like light blue. lndigo. The scar right here on my forehead, that's why l don't ride motorcycles anymore. And l live in that trailer. All this land is mine. l have no idea what l'm gonna do with it. So that's it. That's all you've earned for now. The rest you're just just gonna have to take on faith. [Meredith] And once in a while people may even take your breath away.

                    			[narrator] Last season on Grey's Anatomy: You have to go. I'm late. Seriously. Goodbye uh - Derek. - Yeah. A month ago you were in med school being taught by doctors. - Today, you are the doctors. - [Baile7] You're interns. Grunts. Nobodies. Bottom of the surgical food chain. It's like candy, but with blood, which is so much better. Dr. Shepherd? He's over there. [George] Who feels like they have no idea what they're doing? - Stop looking at me like that. - Like what? Like you've seen me naked. I don't get picked 'cause I slept with my boss and didn't get into med school 'cause I have a famous mother. I used to be a doctor, I think. [Meredith] Fine, George and lzzie, you can move in. [Derek] You blew me off for a bottle of tequila. It's not nearly as much fun to wake up to. You mind movin' this tail wagon? The next time I see you favoring Meredith Grey in any way, I'll make sure she doesn't see the inside of an OR for a month. - I'm your boss. - You don't scare me. - Richard promised chief to both of us. - Keep friends close and enemies closer. - Morning, Dr. Model. - Dr. Evil Spawn. You're not the enemy. You're just the competition. What is this that we're doing here? [Yang] You need a definition? [Meredith] There are other options. It's a tumor. It's pressing against your optic nerve. You've got syphilis. [George] I don't know how this happened. You and Alex? You gave me syphilis? [Derek] Some people would call this a relationship. - Who? - Me. My God, you're falling for him. What makes a hotshot doc leave the Big Apple? - Hi. I'm Addison Shepherd. - Shepherd? You must be the woman who's been screwing my husband. [Meredith] To be a good surgeon, you have to think like a surgeon. Emotions are messy. Tuck them neatly away and step into a clean, sterile room where the procedure is simple. Cut, suture and close. You look familiar. You been here before? Once. That worked out really well. I know that look. It's one of two things. Either your boss is giving you hell or your boyfriend is. Which is it? Both. But sometimes, you're faced with a cut that won't heal. My boyfriend is my boss, which was a problem. But not as big a problem as the fact that my boyfriend has a wife. T ell you what, this one, it's on the house. A cut that rips its stitches wide open. - What are you doing here? - Your hair's different. - A lot of things are different. - It's longer. It's very Russell Crowe. - What are you doing here? - You just pick up and leave everything? Your house, your practice, your friends? You had a life in Manhattan. Had. And now you have a girlfriend in Seattle. - She seems sweet. - The ice you're on. Thin. She's young. That wide-eyed, he's-a-brain-surgeon thing, but still sweet. Which was what you were going for. The anti-Addison? If you came to try to win me back, forget it. I did. I flew across the country to reminisce over wedding photos, get drunk, fall into bed, and make you realize you can't live without me. Relax. Derek, I'm here for work. I'm helming the TTTS case you guys admitted last week and from Richard's briefing - He knew you were coming? - He asked me. Didn't he say? - No. He didn't. - Hm. Surprise. The hair, though. You know I've always had a thing for Russell Crowe. Let me see it. No lacerations, minimal swelling. - George really knocked you around. - He's a lightweight. - Could've pinned him in a second. - Why didn't you? Are you kidding? I'm riding a career in Plastics all the way to the bank. Can't afford to injure these babies. - Especially over O'Malley. - You had it coming. The dude punches like my sister. So, by your definition then you got beat up by a girl. [chuckles] - All hail the champ! - [whooping] So my guy Alex finally got what was coming to him. - George knocked him down in one punch. - I don't want to talk about it! Brag, champ, brag! You've earned it! Can I have a beer, please? Let's play a game of whose life sucks the most. - I'll win. I always win. - No, you don't want to play with me. Oh, I do. I'll even go first. Derek's married. George, beer is dripping from your nostrils. - Told you I'd win. - No, you don't win. Did you hear me? I said Derek is married. As in pigheaded, adulterous, liar married. Nothing you could say could top that. I'm pregnant. I win. - [groans] - [man] Joe, you all right? - [smashing] - [man] Hey, Joe! OK. Maybe Joe wins. - Lie down. - [man] The medics are coming. - You called the gurney patrol? - Sit back and relax. - The hospital will run some tests - Tests? I don't need tests. I'm fine! You collapsed! On the floor. It's your bar. You know how filthy this floor is. - Pulse is strong. - Minor skull contusions. - You're sleeping with someone? - What? - Even George got some action. - Correction. George got some syphilis. - How could I not know? - Forget this. The hospital is right across the street. I can sure as hell walk across the street by myself. - I think we should - No, I got him. Joe! All right. Details. You're pregnant? What are you gonna do? Look, you know what happens to pregnant interns. I'm not switching to the vagina squad or spending my life popping zits. I'm too talented. Surgery's my life. Which begs the question: Who are you sleeping with? - Just a guy. - That's all I get? You can't just bring something like this up and expect me to drop it. Well, watch me. Don't you have a date with McDreamy? - More like McMarried. - McWhat? I came to check on Joe. - You think he's gonna be OK? - Will he need an operation? [Derek] Operation, yes. OK, hard to tell. Basilar artery's like a balloon. Subarachnoid bleeding. - Aneurysm the size of a golf ball. - No way to clip something like that. - Not without magic fingers. - Or a standstill operation. You're doing a standstill He's doing a standstill operation. I'd like to try. First I need some additional patient history, overnight labs, and a cerebral angio. - I'm drunk. - [Derek] Meredith [lzzie, softl7] McBastard. Ahem. - What are you doing? - Uh I am on her side. But we're talking a possible standstill here. Recognize. - Meredith! - Go away! Just wait. We should discuss this. Here's a thought. No! Quit following me! - At least let me explain. - Explain? You should have explained the night we met in the bar. Before any of the rest of it. - That would have been a good time. - Look, I know how you feel. Do you? Somehow I doubt that. Because if you did, you would shut up, and you would turn around and go back inside, because you would realize that I am this close to getting in my car and running you down in the parking lot! - Where're your keys? - I'm fine! Meredith, give me your keys. [George] Let's go home. [man and woman laugh] -and the husband was the - [Richard laughs] [clears throat] [sighs, clears throat] Well, I will be back in the morning to report for duty. And you get some rest. What is she doing here? You and I both know she's the best in the field. Bringing Addie out was a business decision, nothing personal. Oh, well, what a relief. It's not personal. It is personal to me. The workings of my surgical unit don't have any - Don't include my wife! - Don't include your private life! Burke will act as chief of surgery until I'm back on my feet. You gave chief to Burke. There's no room for personal in being chief. - What is that supposed to mean? - You have been sleeping with an intern. [chuckles] So I guess part of being chief is personal. Close the door on your way out. L.S. [woman on PA] IV nurse call ICU, extension 323. Babcock. IV nurse call ICU, extension 323. Right-angle clamp. Oh. I'm gonna sterilize everything when I'm done. The scrub nurses won't know I was here. My lips are sealed. Dr. Tucker to Radiology. Dr. Tucker to Radiology. So, I have a question to ask. I checked the schedule and I noticed that you and I are both off tonight. I made reservations. I have a favorite restaurant. None of those were questions. Would you like to go out to dinner with me tonight? You know, the OR is the one place where I can come and think. I'm thinking right now, OK? Of course. [metal scrapes] I get it. I'm not a violent person. I'm a pacifist. But, you know, he just kept pushing and push He pushed me, I pushed back. I was pushed. And now he If Alex tries to lay a hand on you, just tell me, I'll take care of it. You [laughs] I don't need you to take care of it. If Alex starts something I'll handle it myself. I can handle it. OK, people, assignments. Yang, you're on discharges. O'Malley report to room E19. Grey come see me, and who was on call last night? Sloppy, sloppy, sloppy. Redo these and return them to me before lunch, understood? - Understood. - Karev, don't tempt me. - Somebody's popular. - Meaning? There's been a special request, just for you. [Burke] The chief runs through all of this? Before lunch. After, you've got calls to return, a budget to approve, two staff meetings, and four of Richard's surgeries, including your own. Absolutely. No problem. [chuckles] Virgins. So. Congratulations are in order. Don't sweat it, I'll only be your boss for a few days. I'm aware of Richard's recovery time. I operated on him, remember? I do. He survived and chose me to take over while recruiting your wife. Clearly, he has brain damage. Or is it your ex-wife? I'm a little fuzzy on that. - We're separated. - Sorry to interrupt, Dr. Burke. - You're never interrupting. - She always is. I was checking to see if Dr. Burke secured the intern The intern you requested? He did. [Addison] Define TTTS. Twin-twin transfusion syndrome. Conjoined fetal twins. Connected by? - Blood vessels in the placenta. - Meaning? One twin gets too much blood, the other too little, endangering both. I'd expect you to know that, Grey. You said probably nothing could be done. TTTS is usually impossible to correct. Unless you are one of a handful of surgeons in the world who knows how to separate fetal blood vessels. Which, luckily for you, I am. So we'll get you into surgery tomorrow. If you have any questions at all, please ask Dr. Grey. From what I have seen, she is one of the hospital's most popular interns. I could've answered your question given a chance. Chin up. I'm this tough on everyone, not just the women my husband sleeps with. Order an ultrasound for her and pre-op labs in Hi. Can I have the chart for E19, please? Thank you. Oh, good, you're here. Let's get started. OK. - O'Malley. - Yeah? - You're touching me. - Yeah. No. Carmen I want you to listen to me very carefully. As long as I'm in here, I don't know what's happening out there. With my doctors. My patients. My hospital. You are my eyes today. My ears. - I want you to be a sponge. - A sponge? You report any and everything happening in this hospital to me. - I'm an investigative sponge. - I'm not fooling around. There's too much been happening lately under my radar. It stops today. [woman on PA] IV nurse, call ICU extension 3231. IV nurse, call ICU extension 3231. Burke. You gave Grey to Addison. Are you sure about that? That's not your call, Shepherd. And for the record, I'm always sure. Did you need me? As the new chief, I'm - lnterim chief. - "Chief" nonetheless. Ever attempt a standstill surgery? [Derek] It's the location of the aneurysm that makes it tricky. Your body temperature would be lowered to protect it and stop the heart. Which stops blood flow to the brain which reduces the risk of rupture. I'll have 45 minutes to clip the aneurysm. - Before I get the heart started again. - You wanna freeze my body, - drain my blood, and stop my heart? - And bring you back. - In under 45 minutes? - [Derek] Right. - If you go over, is it free? - No. Dr. Yang, you can go and handle the pre-op labs now. How much? How much does something like this cost? [Derek] Don't worry about that right now. Look, you guys say that you can kill me and bring me back, I believe you. You're doctors, but I own a bar. I don't got any insurance so I'm not that concerned about the surgery so much as what I'm gonna do when I survive it. I need a number. Ten grand? Twenty? - Thirty? - It's a couple hundred at least. At least. [Alex] Who's Halloran? Patient in 4115. - [woman on PA] Dr. Cole, call the OR. - Red hair? Wife knits all the time? He had the colectomy? Ah, colon dude. That's right. Who's Monterroso? She spiked a post-op fever. You spent two hours with her. Hernia chick. That's right. You've treated them for a week and you don't know their names? In Surgery we don't waste time getting to know the patients. - They're meat, we're butchers. - They're humans. You do know what a human is, Evil Spawn? I'm not evil. Unless evil turns you on. Do you ever wake up, realize nobody likes you, and, I don't know, care? Oh. [chuckles] I think somebody likes me. [Yang] Hey. What, you don't speak now you're chief? Burke! - What do you want? - What? What do you want? You don't want to go out to dinner. You don't want to meet me in the on-call room, and you don't want to talk to me. I could pretend I know, but I don't have your home phone number. - So tell me, what do you want? - Don't yell at me. - We're having a conversation. - What do you want? I don't know! Figure it out. What's the report? No report. It's very quiet today, sir. There's no gossip? Surgeries I should know about? - Now come on, what's the buzz? - You know, not in halls, not in OR. Not in the stairwells. Especially nothing happening in the, you know They're just stairwells. [Alex wolf whistles] They told me you were in a nightgown, but I thought I'd come see. Very nice, huh. Heard O'Malley laid you out cold. Nice eye. - Whoa, who sent that? - We all pitched in. The whole floor. Well, please, tell the whole floor a big thank you. Yeah, I will. Alex, you gotta get me out of here, man. Get me transferred to County Hospital. Not County. Here, they can kill you and bring you back, but at County, they can just kill you. No joke. I can't afford this place, man. I'm gonna lose the bar. - Hey, Joe, how you doing? - Hey, Scooter. OK. That's mine? - We'll start by saving your life. - The bar is my life. You know that. You've been at last call every night since you moved here. I'm gonna have to shut it down or sell it. You can't do that. Place is an institution. I've owned the bar across the street for 14 years, and I've never been inside this hospital till now. I'll pay my tab. That's gotta be good for something. How much is it? Close to a grand. How about I pay, like, 60? That's good. And I'll pay you back later. Hey, champ! [PA] Orderly, please report to station three. Orderly, report to station three. What does it take to go after another woman's husband? - Excuse me? - It happened to me. Jeff moved in with a long-legged miniskirt who answers his phones three weeks into my pregnancy. That gel is really cold. I'm sorry. I'm sorry about your husband. Are you sorry about Dr. Montgomery-Shepherd's husband? I'm going to be checking a few things today. I bet she asked to work with you. It's what I would have done. I'm gonna go check on your labs. [steady beeping] [retches] [flushing] Heya, sunshine. Deep breath. Morning sickness must suck. Just so we're clear, do not breathe a word of what you heard last night to anyone. Not about me. Not about Meredith. Not about Meredith and Dr. McDreamy - Hey, Dr. Burke. - Joe. Um, vital signs stable overnight. Today's CT shows no re-bleeding. The EKG shows um, normal sinus rhythm. No ischemia, no dysrhythmias. Looking good. Page me if there are any changes. - [baby wails] - [George] Oh, hi, Chief. No, not much going on. Other than your interim chief making out with my friend in the stairwell, but, hey Sponge duty sucks. - You talking to yourself now? - Yes. No! Damn it, I'm a bad sponge. A leaky sponge. I'm gonna leak all the wrong secrets. I'm a bad liar, can't even lie about talking to myself. You look nice today. Wore my new lip gloss 'cause my ex-boyfriend's wife looks like lsabella freakin' Rossellini, and I'm like me. I'm trying to outdo her when she's the victim here. How crazy is that? Not crazy. Smart. You know, gloss, you know, prevents chapped lips and you Ex-boyfriend? I'm an evil mistress. Well, still. You look nice. Thanks. What are you doing here? [stutters] Come on, O'Malley. Out with it. OK. Can you think of any reason, any reason at all, really, why Cristina would be kissing Burke? [elevator bell] After all this time. All your warnings about me sleeping with my boss, - and you're doing the same thing? - It's not the same. - It's the same - You two are in a relationship. And you and Burke are in? Switzerland. It's very neutral there. And they make very nice watches. Have you even bothered to tell Burke about the baby? - Are you going to? - Look, Meredith, can we not go there? Can everyone just accept that I like to keep some things to myself? - I don't discuss everything to death. - Well, why even confide in me at all if you're so intent on not discussing it? Why even tell me? When I found out about the miniskirt, I called her up and took her to lunch. It was perfectly civil. I said I didn't hold it against her, that these things happened. But, really? I wanted to put a face on the bitch that got my husband to throw away - Got a second? - Depends on what you need. Who the hell is Dr. McDreamy? Me. I'm Dr. McDreamy. I'm tall, handsome. I lean against things and ponder the difficulties of dating beautiful women. I'm trying to be a surgeon here! - That took a lot of nerve. - She came highly recommended. - Right. - So you don't recommend her? - I did not say that. - Just not her medical skills. - Dr. Shepherd. - [both] Yes? Labs confirm what look like abnormalities on the ultrasound. - I think you should come and see. - Fine. Let's go. - Meredith. Meredith - Don't. [PA] Any available IV nurse to OR Two. Any available IV nurse to OR Two. Well, no report. You know, same nothing as earlier. I should go. Oh, actually there is something, sir. - Burke and Shepherd marking territory? - No, sir. It's about Joe. The bartender. The standstill patient. See. Bilateral pleural effusion with evidence of subQ edema. In English, please? We've detected what looks like beginning heart failure in the twins. - Don't be alarmed. - Are my babies gonna be OK? I'm going to take you into surgery now. Book the OR. Move. [Joe] Tell Pete to wash out the taps every night. Not every other night. And remind him that the delivery truck comes at 6:00a.m. Kegs go in the back. Oh, another thing. There's petty cash on the top shelf in the storage closet. We're operating on patients. That's it. - I know, but - I sympathize. I do. But solving Joe's finances is not my job, it's not your job, and it's sure as hell not the job I assigned you today. It seems wrong to cut him open, sew him up, and leave him, left with nothing. If we can save his life, we'll hardly be leaving him with nothing. [steady beeping] That's as far as I can go for now. Let's start cooling him. Can't see much from back here, O'Malley. I know. I'm trying to find a loophole to help Joe. - [George] You know Joe? - Oh, yeah. I was the only female intern my year. I didn't know anybody and nobody knew me except Joe. He knew me. Oh. So, you and Joe? All you people ever think about is how to get into somebody's pants. You're nasty. That's why you got syphilis. Joe was the first person here to say I'd make a good surgeon. Not that he knew anything about it. But it was somethin' when I had nothin'. Oh, sure. I'm the guy with the heart of stone and you brought snacks. - It's a working lunch. - Snacks to watch Joe die. He's not gonna "die" die. They'll bring him back. He is going to "die" die. No "pulse" pulse. He'll be "dead" dead. It's a granola bar, Alex. Not a bag of supersize popcorn and a box of chocolate movie mints. That's it. Dead! Excuse me. [Addison] Julie, we're gonna go in laparoscopically. You're not gonna feel anything. And neither are the twins. OK, let's get going! Ten blade. Begin with a three-millimeter incision. - [Burke] We stop the blood flow? - To protect the brain. Operate in a bloodless field so the aneurysm won't rupture. - [Burke] And cool the body? - To induce hypothermia. Keeps the tissue viable until the blood is restored. Body temp is at 60 degrees. OK, Joe. Time to die. [whirring] - [continuous beep] - Flatline. - We've got 45 minutes, people. - Start the clock. Got it. [chatter] [Derek] So what's your "Joe" story? Seems like everybody here has one. You first. OK. I went to Joe's place the night before I started working here. I'd only been in town, you know, a few days. I met a woman. I got drunk and she took advantage of me. Or she got drunk and I took advantage of her. I got drunk and she took No. We were drunk. Definitely. Somebody took advantage. Either way, l look at it as my initiation to Seattle. - What about you? - Oh, I don't have one. I just wanted to hear yours. [George] So, technically, the paperwork just needs to be submitted by midnight of the day of the surgery to be considered? Oh, good. Well, thank you very much. Thanks. How you doing there, Grey? Good. I'm good. You know, I'm very sweet once you get to know me. - No, you're not. - We could be good friends. - Alex. Never, ever. Ever. - Why not? Give me one reason why we could? What about you is even remotely human? It's going too slowly. - I hope Joe can pull through this. - He can. He will. He has to. [Derek] Damn it. I can't get the clamp to hold. Give me the bipolars. I'm gonna go in at a different angle. Time remaining? - [Derek] lrrigation, please. - 17 minutes. Shepherd, I need eight minutes to get him back, to warm him up. Time to make the next 17 minutes count. [Derek] Right there, go in from there. See it? See, that's why we can't do it right there. [George] He's dead. Technically. Which is science, and this is a huge thing. So some research foundation has to be interested. So, in essence, you want to donate Joe's body to science? At least for the next 17 minutes. - "Privately funded grant." - For educational purposes. We're a teaching hospital. The standstill surgery qualifies. I didn't peg you for the type to ignore my instructions. All due respect, sir, it's worth a shot. It's someone's life. It's always someone's life, O'Malley. You're hovering. - You can leave now. - OK. [grumbles] [nurse] Eight minutes. We need to start rewarming, Shepherd. Take the bipolars, please. Thank you. Shepherd, we need to start warming him up, now! - Hang on. - Now. I need it now, Shepherd. I can't seem to get I just can't get behind the aneurysm. If I could get behind the aneurysm, I could There it is. Got it. That's it. - Are you sure? - I'm always sure. [Derek] Good work, everybody. It's all yours there, Chief. OK, let's grab Joe before he decides to go into the light. Start warming him up. Clamps are coming off. Turn the pump on. Watch cerebral perfusion pressures. Keep M.A.P. at greater than 60, please. [Richard] I know you're enjoying yourself, Preston. It's a power kick to be the chief. You're never more surrounded. Never more alone. You're everyone's father, everyone's boss, and no one's friend. Choices you make. Clean slices and neat stitches. No emotions, no compromise, no personal life. - But, Richard - I just had brain surgery. I'm surrounded by fruit baskets. The only people who've been in this room come and kiss my ass. I gave you a shot for a reason, Preston. You and l, we're the same. We put the job first. That was the single most amazing surgery I have ever witnessed. You, you killed a man and brought him back to life. You, like, raised the dead. God, how does that feel? Are you rushing? Is it Like you wouldn't believe. Hey, do you still have those reservations? 'Cause I'm starving. Cristina, I think there's something we should discuss. Yeah. Yeah, there is. It's pretty clear. It is? We've been fooling ourselves to think that we can continue without consequences. Consequences We have careers to think about. Reputations. We both put the job first. You are very focused. I respect that. - Thank you. - You're welcome. [PA] Any available IV nurse to OR two. Oh, you're ending this? I think it's best to make a clean break. OK. Before it gets too involved. Before it gets Messy. Right, right. That would be bad. It's nothing personal. Get in here, O'Malley. OK. I tried. I really tried. But there's a lot of stuff happening out there. Stuff I can't tell you. Stuff I won't tell you. Crazy stuff. Stuff I'm gonna have nightmares about. But I'm not gonna tell you about any of it. Because it doesn't matter. Not when there's a guy who we all know and love who's gonna be bankrupt because he needed a surgery to save his life. - I spent the whole day on it. - O'Malley Let me finish. You're wrong, sir. Now you can fire me, or bring me up on disciplinary action or whatever. I'm telling you, Joe deserves Deserves our help. Couldn't help yourself, could you? Whether or not it'd win you any points, even from me. I signed your request. Give it to Patricia, she'll know what to do. - Joe may keep his bar after all. - Thank you, sir. - O'Malley! - Yes? Yell at me again, and I'll snap you like a twig. Yes, sir. See? Just a small scar. And my babies? [PA] Dr. Cole, call the OR. Your babies are doing very well. And Dr. Grey will be back to check on you a little bit later. I'd prefer it if Dr. Grey were taken off the case. Why, is there a problem? Just reminds me of someone I don't like. Someone my husband likes a lot. Particularly in lingerie. You understand. No, no, I don't understand. Well, she's sleeping with your husband, right? Ms. Philips, I lack Dr. Grey's class and patience so, let me set the record straight. My husband didn't cheat on me, I cheated on him. So the wronged woman here, Dr. Grey. So, I think you owe her one hell of an apology. One night I parked my car, I unlock my front door, go inside my house, and something's different. Nothing's different, everything's the same but yet, still, something's different. And I stand there for a while. And then I know. See, there are moments for me, you know, usually when I'm in the OR, when I just know what's gonna happen next. So I go upstairs. As I walk down the hall, I try to prepare myself for what I'm gonna see when I go into my bedroom. I step on a man's jacket that doesn't belong to me. And everything I think I know just shifts. Because the jacket that doesn't belong to me is a jacket that I recognize. And what I know now is that when I go into my bedroom, I'm not just gonna see that my wife is cheating on me. I'm gonna see that my wife is cheating on me with Mark, who happened to be my best friend. It's just so pedestrian, common and dirty, and cruel. Mostly just cruel. I left. Came out here. - And you met me. - And I met you. Well, what was I to you? The girl you screwed to get over being screwed? You were like coming up for fresh air. It's like I was drowning and you saved me. That's all I know. It's not enough. [# Joe Purdy: The City] [Meredith] They say practice makes perfect. [engine] Theory is, the more you think like a surgeon the more you become one. The better you get at remaining neutral, clinical. Cut, suture, close. And the harder it becomes to turn it off. Thought I might see your ugly mug in here tonight. Did you hear the good news?  to stop thinking like a surgeon. [Alex] O'Malley! I heard what you did, champ. [Meredith] And remember what it means to think like a human being. The clinic has a policy. They wouldn't let me confirm my appointment unless I designated an emergency contact person. Someone to be there, just in case, and to help me home, you know, after. Anyway, I put your name down. That's why I told you I'm pregnant. You're my "person." I am? Yeah, you are. Whatever. Whatever. He dumped me. You realize this constitutes hugging? Shut up. I'm your "person."
