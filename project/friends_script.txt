                    			The One Where It All Began (Pilot) There's nothing to tell. It's just some guy I work with. You're going out with the guy. There has to be something wrong with him. All right, Joey. Be nice. So does he have a hump and a hairpiece? Wait, does he eat chalk? I don't want her to go through what I did with Carl. Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a date. It's just two people going out to dinner and not having sex. Sounds like a date to me. I'm in high school, in the cafeteria.. and I realize I'm totally naked. I've had that dream. Then I look down and I realize there is a phone.. there. - Instead of - That's right! Never had that one. All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring. What do I do? Everyone starts looking at me. They weren't looking at you before? Finally, I figure I'd better answer it. And it turns out it's my mother. Which is very, very weird because she never calls me. Hi. He says, "Hello," I want to kill myself. You okay? I feel like someone pulled my intestine out of my mouth.. - and tied it around my neck. - Cookie? Carol moved her stuff out today. - Let me get you some coffee. - Thanks. No, don't! Stop cleansing my aura. - Just leave my aura alone, okay? - Fine, be murky. - I'll be fine. I hope she'll be happy. - No, you don't. No, I don't. To hell with her. She left me! You never knew she was a lesbian? No! Okay? Why does everyone keep fixating on that? She didn't know. How should I know? Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian. Did I say that out loud? I told Mom and Dad last night. They took it pretty well. Oh, really? So that hysterical phone call from a woman sobbing.. "I'll never have grandchildren," was what? A wrong number? Sorry. Look, you're feeling a lot of pain right now. You're angry. You're hurting. Can I tell you what the answer is? Strip joints! Hey, you're single. Have some hormones. But I don't want to be single, okay? I just want to be married again. And I just want a million dollars! - Rachel? - Oh, Monica! Thank God! I went to your building.. and a guy with a hammer said you'd be here, and you are. - Can I get you some coffee? - Decaf. Everybody, this is Rachel, a Lincoln High survivor. This is everybody. Chandler and Phoebe.. Joey. Remember my brother, Ross? Sure! You want to tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids? Well, it started about a half-hour before the wedding. I was in the room with all the presents.. and I was looking at this really gorgeous Limoges gravy boat. When all of a sudden Sweet 'N Low? I realized I was more turned on by this gravy boat than Barry. I got freaked out, and it hit me: How much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head. I always knew he looked familiar, but.. I had to get out of there, and I started wondering.. "Why am I doing this," and "Who am I doing it for?" I didn't know where to go, and I know we've drifted apart.. but you're the only person I know here. - Who wasn't invited to the wedding. - I hoped that wouldn't be an issue. I guess he bought her the pipe organ, and she's really not happy about it. "Tuna or egg salad! Decide!" "I'll have whatever Christina's having." Daddy, I just I can't marry him. I'm sorry. I just don't love him. Well, it matters to me! "If I let go of my hair, my head will fall off." She should not be wearing those pants. Push her down the stairs! Push her! Push her down the stairs! Come on, Daddy, listen! All my life, everyone's always told me, "You're a shoe!" "You're a shoe!" What if I don't want to be a shoe? What if I want to be a purse? Or a hat? No, I don't want you to buy me a hat! It's a metaphor, Daddy! You can see where he'd have trouble. Look, Daddy, it's my life. Well, maybe I'll just stay here with Monica. I guess we've established she's staying with Monica. Well, maybe that's my decision. Maybe I don't need your money. Wait! I said maybe! Just breathe. That's it. Try to think of nice, calm things. Raindrops on roses And whiskers on kittens Doorbells and sleigh bells And something with mittens La la la something And noodles with string I'm all better now. I helped. This is probably for the best. Independence. Controlling your life. The whole hat thing. You can always come to Joey. Me and Chandler live across the hall. He's away a lot. Stop hitting on her! It's her wedding day. Like there's a rule, or something? I got it. Please don't do that again. It's a horrible sound. It's Paul. Oh, God, is it 6:30? Buzz him in. - Who's Paul? - Paul, the wine guy? Maybe. Your "not a real date" is with Paul, the wine guy? - He finally asked you out? - Yes! It's a "Dear Diary" moment. - Rach, I can cancel. - Please, go, I'll be fine. Ross, are you okay? Do you want me to stay? That'd be good. - Really?- Go on! It's Paul, the wine guy! Does he sell it, drink it? Or he just complains a lot? Hi, come in! Paul, this is.. everybody. Everybody, this is Paul. - The wine guy. - I didn't catch your name. Paul? I'll be right back. I've just gotta go A-wandering? Change. Sit down. Two seconds. I just pulled out four eyelashes. That can't be good. Hey, Paul, here's a tip. She really likes it when you rub her neck in the same spot.. until it starts to get red. Shut up, Joey! What are you up to tonight? I was supposed to be headed for Aruba on my honeymoon.. so, nothing. Right. You're not even getting your honeymoon. Although, Aruba. This time of year? Talk about your.. big lizards. If you don't want to be alone tonight.. Joey and Chandler are helping me with my furniture. We're very excited about it. Thanks. But I'm just going to hang out here. - It's been a long day. - Oh, sure. Phoebe, wanna help? I wish I could, but I don't want to. Love is sweet as summer showers Love is a wondrous work of art But your love Oh, your love, your love Is like a giant pigeon Crapping on my heart Thank you. I'm supposed to attach a bracket-y thing to the side things.. using a bunch of these little worm guys. I have no bracket-y thing. I see no worm guys whatsoever.. and I cannot feel my legs. - We got a bookcase. - It's beautiful. What's this? I would have to say that is an L-shaped bracket. - Which goes where? - I have no idea. - Done with the bookcase. - All finished. This was Carol's favorite beer. She always drank it out of the can. I should have known. - Start with that, we're out of here. - Please don't spoil all this fun. Let me ask you. She got the furniture, the stereo, the good TV. What did you get? - You guys. - You got screwed. - Oh, my God. - I know. I'm such an idiot. I should've known when she went to the dentist five times a week. I mean, how clean can teeth get? My brother's going through that. How did you get over it? He might accidentally break something valuable of hers. - Say her - Leg? That's one way of doing it. I went for the watch. You actually broke her watch? The worst I ever did was shred my old boyfriend's favorite towel. - Steer clear of you. - That's right. Barry, I'm sorry. I am so sorry. You probably think it's about making love with your socks on, but it isn't. It's about me. And I just The machine cut me off again. Anyway.. I know that some lucky girl is going to become Mrs. Barry Finkel. But it isn't me. It's not me. Not that I have any idea who "me" is right now, but you just I'm divorced. - I'm only 26, and I'm divorced! - Shut up! That only took me an hour. We haven't had a relationship that's lasted longer than a Mento. You have had the love of a woman for four years. Four years of closeness and sharing, after which she ripped your heart out. That is why we don't do it! I don't think that was my point! Know what's scary? What if there's only one woman for everybody? I mean, what if you get one woman, and that's it? Unfortunately, in my case, there was only one woman for her. What are you talking about? One woman. That's like saying there's only one flavor of ice cream. Let me tell you something. There's lots of flavors out there. Rocky road and cookie dough and bing cherry vanilla. You can get them with jimmies or nuts or whipped cream. It's the best thing to happen to you! You got married. You were like, what, 8? Welcome back to the world. Grab a spoon! - I don't know if I'm hungry or horny. - Then stay out of my freezer. Ever since she walked out on me.. What? You wanna spell it out with noodles? It's more of a fifth date kind of revelation. So there's going to be a fifth date? Isn't there? Yeah, yeah. I think there is. What were you going to say? Ever since she left me.. I haven't been able to perform.. sexually. Oh, God! I'm so sorry. Being spit on is probably not what you need right now. How long? - Two years. - Wow. I'm glad you smashed her watch. So you still think you might want that fifth date? Yeah. Yeah, I do. We are gathered here to join Joanie Louise Cunningham.. and Charles. Chachi, Chachi, Chachi.. in the bonds of holy matrimony. See! But Joanie loved Chachi. That's the difference. "Grab a spoon." Do you know how long it's been since I grabbed a spoon? Do the words, "Billy, don't be a hero," mean anything to you? Great story. But I gotta go. I got a date with Andrea. Angela. No, Andrea. Andrea's the screamer. Angela has cats. Right, thanks. It's Julie. I'm out of here. Here's the thing. Even if I could get it together enough.. to ask a woman out.. who am I going to ask? Isn't this amazing? I've never made coffee in my life. - That is amazing. - Congratulations. If I can make coffee, there isn't anything I can't do. I think it's, "If I can invade Poland, there's nothing I can't do." If you feel like you have to make a Western omelet or something.. Although, actually I'm really not that hungry. Oh, good. Lenny and Squiggy are here. - Good morning. - Good morning. - Morning. - Morning, Paul. - Hello, Paul. - Hi. Paul, is it? - Thank you so much. - Stop. Last night was like all my birthdays, both graduations.. plus the barn-raising scene in Witness. We'll talk later. Thank you. That wasn't a real date. What the hell do you do on a real date? Shut up and put my table back. I've got to get to work. If I don't input those numbers, it doesn't make much of a difference. So, like, you guys all have jobs? Yeah, we all have jobs. That's how we buy stuff. - Yeah, I'm an actor. - Have I seen you in anything? I doubt it. Mostly regional work. Unless you saw the Wee One's production of Pinocchio.. at the little theater in the park? It was a job! "Look, Geppetto. I'm a real live boy." - I will not take this abuse. - You're right, I'm sorry. Once I was a wooden boy A little wooden boy You should both know that he's a dead man. Oh, Chandler! How are you doing today? Sleep okay? Did you talk to Barry? I can't stop smiling. I see that. You look like you slept with a hanger in your mouth. I know. He's just so.. - Remember you and Tony Demarco? - Oh, yeah. Well, it's like that. With feelings. - Wow, are you in trouble! - Big time! Want a wedding dress? Hardly used. I think we're getting a little ahead of ourselves. I'm going to get up, go to work, and not think about him all day. Or else I'm going to get up and go to work. - Wish me luck! - What for? I'm gonna go get one of those job things. - Hi, Monica. - Franny, welcome back. - How was Florida? - You had sex, didn't you? - How do you do that? - I hate you. I'm pushing my aunt through Parrot Jungle, you're having sex. So, who? You know Paul? Paul, the wine guy? Yeah, I know Paul. You mean, you know Paul like I know Paul? What? I take credit for Paul. Before me, there was no snap in his turtle for two years. Of course it was a line. Why would anybody do something like that? I assume we want an answer more sophisticated than: "To get you into bed." I hate men. Don't hate. You don't want to put that out into the universe. Is it me? Is it like I have some sort of beacon that only dogs.. and men with emotional problems can hear? Come here. Give me your feet. I just thought he was nice, you know? I can't believe you didn't know it was a line. - Guess what? - You got a job? Are you kidding? I'm trained for nothing. - I was laughed out of 12 interviews. - You're surprisingly upbeat. You'd be too, if you found these boots on sale.. How well you know me. They're my "I don't need a job.. I've got great boots" boots. - How did you pay? - Credit card. And who pays for that? My father. Is this really necessary? I can stop charging any time. You can't live off your parents. I know that. That's why I was getting married. Give her a break. It's hard being on your own. Thank you. I remember when I first came to this city, I was 14. Mom had killed herself, stepdad was in jail. I didn't know anybody here. I ended up living with this albino guy who was cleaning windshields. And then he killed himself. Then I found aromatherapy. So I know exactly how you feel. The word you're looking for is: "Anyway.." - You ready? - No, how can I be ready? "Ready to jump out of the plane with no parachute?" - I can't do this. - I know you can. - No. - You made coffee, you can do anything. Cut. Cut. Cut. You know what? I think we can leave it at that. - Kind of a symbolic gesture. - Rachel, that was a library card. If you listen closely, you can hear a thousand retailers scream. Welcome to the real world! It sucks. You're gonna love it. That's it. Are you going to crash on the couch? - No, I gotta go home sometime. - Are you gonna be okay? Look what I just found on the floor. What? That's Paul's watch. Just put it back where you found it. Oh, boy! All right. - Good night, everybody. - Good night. - I'm sorry. Have it, I don't want it. - Split it? You probably didn't know this, but in high school.. I had a major crush on you. I knew. You did? I figured you thought I was Monica's geeky brother. I did. Listen, do you think..? Try not to let my vulnerability become a factor here. Do you think it would be okay if I asked you out sometime? Yeah. Maybe. Okay. Okay, maybe I will. - Good night. - Good night. See you. Wait, wait. What's with you? I just grabbed a spoon. - I can't believe what I'm hearing. - Can't believe what I'm hearing - What? I said -  What? I said - Would you stop? - Was I doing it again? Yes! I said you had a nice butt. It's just not a great butt. - You won't know a butt if it bit you. - There's an image. Would anybody like more coffee? You made it, or you're serving it? - I'm just serving it. - I'll have a cup of coffee. Kids, new dream. I'm in Las Vegas. Miss, more coffee? Could you give this to that guy over there? Go ahead. Thank you. Sorry. Okay, Las Vegas. I'm in Las Vegas. I'm Liza Minnelli..

                    			You don't understand. For us, kissing is as important as any part. Yeah, right! You serious? Oh, yeah. - Everything is in that first kiss. - Absolutely. For us, kissing's an opening act.. like the comedian you have to sit through.. before Pink Floyd comes out. And it's not that we don't like the comedian. It's just that that's not why we bought the ticket. The problem is, no matter how great the show was.. you girls are looking for the comedian again. We're in the car, fighting traffic, just trying to stay awake. Word of advice: Bring back the comedian. Or next time you'll find yourself listening to that album alone. Are we still talking about sex? The One With the Sonogram at the End No, it's good. It is good. It's just that Doesn't she seem a little angry? Well, she has issues. Does she? Try to live with "Mr. I'm Evolving." He's out while she's home getting the mastodon smell out of the carpet. Marsha, see, these are cave people. Okay, they have issues like: "Gee, that glacier's getting kind of close." Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife? - No. - Yes, it is. Carol, hi! Okay. Yes, it is. I'll catch up with you in the Ice Age. - Can I stay? - No. - Hi. - Hi. - Is this a bad time? - No, it's.. the Stone Age. You look great. I hate that. Sorry. Thanks. You look good too. Well, you know, in here, anyone who.. stands erect.. - What's new? Still a - A lesbian? - I'm pregnant. - Pregnant. She didn't leave in such a hurry after all. This is the Three's Company episode with a misunderstanding. Then I've already seen this one. Are you through with that? Sorry, the swallowing slowed me down. Whose ball of paper is this? Mine. I wrote a note to myself, then I didn't need it. So I balled it up and now I wish I was dead. She already fluffed that pillow. You already fluffed It's fine. I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition. Parents can be cruel about the flatness of a child's pillow. Relax, you do this every time. The place looks great. You got a lasagna here that looks good enough.. to avoid touching. Monica? Hi! Monica, you're scaring me. I mean, you're all chaotic and twirly, you know? Not in a good way. Calm down. You don't see Ross getting twirly every time they come. That's because my parents think Ross can do no wrong. You see, he's "The Prince." They had some big ceremony before I was born. - What? - Ugly Naked Guy got a ThighMaster. - Has anybody seen my engagement ring? - It's beautiful. Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God! No, don't touch that. Like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back. "Hi, Barry, remember me? I'm the girl that stomped on your heart." Now I must return the ring without the ring.. which makes it so much harder. Easy, we'll find it. Won't we? Look, it's gonna be okay. You'll give it back.. - and we'll eat ice cream. - Okay. It's a pear-shaped diamond Any diamond ring we find, we'll run it by you. - When did you have it last? - Doy, right before she lost it. You don't get a lot of "doy" these days. I know I had it this morning. I know I had it when I was in the kitchen with Dinah? - Oh, don't be mad. - You didn't. - Oh, I'm sorry. - I gave you one job! But look how straight those noodles are. That's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagna. I just can't do it. Boys? We're going in. Hi. - That is not a happy "hi." - Carol's pregnant. I found it! What? Yeah. Do that for two hours, you might be where I am about now. That puts that whole pillow thing in perspective. How do you fit into this whole thing? Carol and Susan want me to be involved. But if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved. - It's totally up to me. - She is so great. I miss her. - What does she mean by "involved"? - Your job is done. And the most enjoyable. Phoebe, say something. They want me to go down to this sonogram thing.. with them tomorrow. Remember when life was simpler.. and she was just a lesbian? Those were the days. - What are you gonna do? - I have no idea. No matter what I do, I'm still gonna be a father. This is still ruined, right? Martha Lugwin's daughter is gonna call you. - What's that curry taste? - Curry. I think they're great. I really do. The big Lugwin had a thing for you. - They all had a thing for him. - Oh, Mom. Why is this girl going to call me? She just graduated, and she wants to be something in cooking or food.. I told her you have a restaurant - I don't have, I work in a restaurant. - They don't have to know that. - Ross, help me with the spaghetti. - Yes. Oh, we're having spaghetti. That's easy. We were going to have lasagna. - I love lasagna. - We're not having it. Then why bring it up? He latches on. This will sound unbelievably selfish.. but did you plan to bring up the baby/lesbian thing? It might take the heat off of me. That Rachel. We saw her parents at the club. They were not playing well. I won't say what they spent.. but $40,000 is a lot for a wedding. At least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar. - What's that supposed to mean? - Nothing. - It's an expression. - No, it's not. Don't listen to her. You've always been independent. Even when you were a chubby kid.. and you had no friends, you were just fine. You'd read alone in your room. Your puzzles.. People like Ross need to shoot for the stars. With his museum and his published papers. Others are satisfied with staying where they are. These people never get cancer. They're happy with what they have, content.. like cows. Cows, Dad? She knows how much I love cows. I read about women trying to have it all, and I thank God.. our "Harmonica" doesn't have that problem. - I'm telling you, you'll be fine. - Thank you, Daddy. Oh, so this does work. So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks? Look, I realize you guys have been wondering.. what exactly happened between Carol and me. And so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She lives with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child. She and Susan are going to raise the baby. And you knew about this? Folks are really that bad? Well, you know, these people are pros. They know what they do. They take their time. They get the job done. They say that you can't change your parents. Boy, if you could, I'd want yours. Must pee. It's worse when you're twins. - You're a twin? - We don't speak. She's this high-powered, driven, career-type. - What does she do? - She's a waitress. - Identical? - People say we look alike. But I don't see it. You guys, I kind of gotta clean up now. Chandler, as an only child, you don't have this. No, although I did have an imaginary friend.. who my parents preferred. Hit the lights, please. How long was I in there? - I'm just cleaning up. - Oh, you need any help? Okay, sure. Thanks. Anyway.. So you nervous about Barry tomorrow? A little. A lot. So, got any advice? You know, as someone who's recently been dumped. You may wanna steer clear of the word "dumped." Chances are he's gonna be this broken shell of a man. You should try not to look too terrific. I know it'll be hard. Or I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring. And you can go with Carol and Susan to the ob-gyn. You've got Carol tomorrow. - When did it get so complicated? - Got me. - Remember being in high school? - Yeah. Didn't you think you'd meet someone.. fall in love, and that'd be it? - Ross? - Yes. Yes. Man, I never thought I'd be here. Me neither. Sorry I'm late. I got stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur thing. Anyway.. Hi. - You remember Susan. - How could I forget? Hello, Susan. Good shake, good shake. So, we're just waiting for? - Dr. Oberman. - And is he? - She. - Of course, "she." Is she familiar with our special situation? - Yes, and she's very supportive. - Okay, that's great. No, I'm Oh. Thanks. That opens my cervix. - Barry? - Come on in. - Are you sure? - It's fine. Robbie's gonna be here for hours. So, how are you doing? I'm.. I'm okay. - You look great. - Yeah, well. Dr. Farber, Jason Greenspan's gagging. Be right there. Be back in a second. I dumped him. So, how's this all gonna work? The baby grows in a special place inside Thank you. I mean, how's this gonna work, you know, with us? When important decisions have to be made? - Give me a "for instance." - Well, I don't know. - How about with the baby's name? - Marlon. If it's a boy. Minnie, if it's a girl. As in "Mouse"? As in my grandmother. Still, you say "Minnie," you hear "Mouse." How about..? How about Julia? - Julia. - We agreed on Minnie. We agreed we'd spend our lives together. Things change. Roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table? Sorry about that. So, what have you been up to? Oh, not much. - I got a job. - That's great. Why are you so tan? I went to Aruba. Oh, no. You went on our honeymoon alone? No. I went with.. - Now, this may hurt. - Me? No. I went with Mindy. Mindy? My maid of honor, Mindy? Yeah, we're kind of a thing now. You got plugs! Careful. They haven't quite taken yet. And you got lenses. You hate sticking your finger in your eye. Not for her. Listen, I really wanted to thank you. Okay. A month ago, I wanted to hurt you more than I've ever wanted to. And I'm an orthodontist. You know, you were right. I thought we were happy. We weren't happy. But with Mindy.. now I'm happy. - Spit. - What? Me. Anyway.. I guess this belongs to you. Or maybe some day Mindy. Like she'd settle for that. Yeah, that's true. But I think it's a nice ring.. and thank you for giving it to me. Thank you for giving it back. Hello! - Please, what's wrong with Helen? - Helen Geller? - I don't think so. - It's not gonna be Helen Geller. - Thank you. - No, I mean, it's not Geller. It'll be Helen Willick? No, actually, we talked about Helen Willick Bunch. Wait a minute. Why is she in the title? It's my baby too. Really? I don't remember you making any sperm. And we all know what a challenge that is. - You two, stop it. - She gets a credit. I'm in there too. Helen Willick Bunch Geller? I think that borders on child abuse. Of course not. I'm suggesting Geller Willick Bunch. See what he does? He knows no one's gonna say all those names. They'll call her Geller. He gets his way. My way? You think this is my way? Of all the ways I ever imagined this moment being.. this is not my You know what? This is too hard. Knock, knock. How are we? Any nausea? - A little. - Just a little. I was wondering about the mother-to-be, but thanks for sharing. - Lie back. - You know what? I'm gonna go. I don't think I can be involved in this family thing. - Oh, my God! - Look at that. I know. Well, isn't that amazing? What are we supposed to be seeing here? I don't know, but I think it's about to attack the Enterprise. If you tilt your head and relax your eyes.. it kind of looks like an old potato. Then don't do that, all right? Monica, what do you think? - Are you welling up? - No. - You are. You're welling up. - I'm not. - You're gonna be an aunt. - Oh, shut up. Hi, Mindy. Hi, it's Rachel. Yeah, I'm fine. I saw Barry today. Yeah, he told me. No, it's okay. Really, it's okay. I hope you two are very happy. I really do. And, Min, you know, if everything works out.. and you guys get married and have kids.. I hope they have his hairline and your nose! That was a cheap shot, but I feel so much better now!

                    			- Hi, guys. - Hey, Phoebe. - How did it go? - Not so good. He walked me home and said, "Let's do this again." He said, "Let's do this again." That's good, right? Translated, "Let's do this again" means, "You'll never see me naked." Since when? Since always. It's, like, dating language. Like, "It's not you" means, "It is you." "You're nice" means, "I'll be dating alcoholics.. and complaining about them to you." "We should see other people" means: "Ha-ha, I already am!" Everybody knows this? Cushions the blow. Like your parents putting the dog to sleep.. and saying it went to a farm. That's funny. Because our parents actually did.. send our dog off to live on a farm. Ross? Hello! The Milner's farm in Connecticut? The Milners had this unbelievable farm. They had horses and rabbits to chase. And it was.. Oh, my God! Chi-Chi! The One With the Thumb How does it feel knowing you're about to die? Warden, in five minutes my pain will be over. But you'll live with the knowledge that you sent an honest man to die. That was really good! Thanks. Let's keep going. So, what do you want from me, Dimon? Huh? I just wanna go back to my cell, because in my cell I can smoke. Smoke away! I think this is why Dimon smokes in his cell alone. - What? - Relax your hand. Let your wrist go. Not so much! All right. Now take a puff. Right. - Give it to me. - I'm not giving you a cigarette. It's fine. Do you want to get this part or not? Here. When you hold it, you feel right. You feel complete. - You miss it? - No, not so much. All right. Now we smoke. Oh, my God! - Give me that! - No. You've got options. You can smoke like this: - Chandler - Or hold it in your mouth. Give me the cigarette! - You try. - Thank you. Okay, how's this? Okay, that's not bad. All right, when you're finished, it's cool if you flick it. All right, you keep practicing.. and I'll go put out the sofa. I thought it was foot size. No. It's the distance from the tip of a guy's thumb.. to the tip of his index finger. That's ridiculous. Can I use either thumb? I'd rather go with the foot theory. All right. Don't tell me. Decaf cappuccino for Joey. Coffee, black. Latte. And an iced tea. - I'm getting good at this. - Excellent! Good for me! - You okay, Phoebe? - It's not worth It's my bank. - What did they do? - It's nothing I get my mail and open their monthly "statement." Easy! And there's $500 extra in my account. Satan's minions at work again! Now I have to go deal with them - What are you talking about? Keep it! - It's not mine. If I kept it, I'd be stealing. But if you spent it, it would be like shopping. Say I bought a great pair of shoes. Know what I'd hear with every step? "Not mine. Not mine. Not mine." Even if I was happy and skipping, I'd hear: "Not-not mine. Not-not mine." We're with you. We got it. I'd never be able to enjoy it. It'd be this giant karmic debt. Chandler, what are you doing? What are you doing? Oh, gross! - What is this? - I'm smoking! You've been so good for three years! And this is my reward. Think about what you went through when you quit. Forget about you. Think about what we went through! So this time I won't quit. - Put it out! - I'm putting it out! Oh, no! I can't drink this now. I'm gonna go. I've got a date. With Alan again? How's it going? It's going pretty good. It's nice and we're having fun. When do we get to meet him? Let's see, it's Monday.. - Never. - Come on! Not after what happened with Steve. What do you mean? We love Steve. Steve was sexy! Sorry. I don't know how I feel yet. Let me figure it out. Then can we meet him? No. Sorry. Joey. Let it go. Why should they meet him? I bring a guy home and they're like.. coyotes picking off the weak members of the herd. Listen, as someone who's seen more than her share of bad beef.. I'll tell you, that is not such a terrible thing. Your friends are just looking after you. I wish that once I'd date a guy they liked. You realize the odds of that happening are slimmer.. - if they never get to meet the guy. - I know. - Can't I whimper a little bit? - Whimper. Okay, I'm done. Let it go, Ross. You didn't know Chi-Chi. - Do you all promise? - We promise. We'll be good. Chandler, do you promise to be good? You can come in, but your filter-tip buddy stays outside! "Dear Ms. Buffay. Thank you for calling. We've credited you $500. We're sorry for the inconvenience.. and hope you'll accept this football phone.. as our gift." Do you believe it? Now I have $ 1000 and a football phone. What bank is this? Okay, it's him. - Who is it? - Alan. Chandler! He's here! Do I look okay? One more button. Closed! How about closed? - I didn't know. - Yeah. Please be good. Remember how much you all like me? Alan, this is everybody. Everybody, this is Alan. I've heard so much about all you guys. I'll call you tomorrow. Thanks. Let's let the Alan-bashing begin. Who's gonna take the first shot? Come on! I'll go. Let's start with how he kept picking I'm sorry, I can't do this. We loved him. We loved him! Wait! We're talking about someone I'm going out with? That pimento trick! I'll never look at an olive the same way again. And did you notice? Know what was great? His smile was crooked. - Yes! Like the man in the shoe! - What shoe? From the rhyme. There was a man With a crooked smile Who lived in a shoe For a while So I think Alan.. is the yardstick by which future boyfriends will be measured. Future boyfriends? - I think this could be "it." - Really? I'd marry him for his David Hasselhoff impression alone. You know I'll be doing that at parties. - Know what I like most? - What? The way he makes me feel about myself. How was the game? Well.. We won! Fantastic! Question. How is that possible? - Alan. - He was unbelievable! Like the cartoon where Bugs Bunny plays every position. It was first base, Alan. Second base, Alan.. It was like he made us into a team. We sure showed those Hasidic jewelers a thing or two about softball. Can I ask a question? Do you think Alan is sometimes.. What? I don't know. A little too "Alan"? Oh, no. Not possible. You can never be too "Alan." It's his innate "Alan-ness" that we adore. I, personally, could have a gallon of Alan. - Hey, Lizzy. - Hey, weird girl. - I brought alphabet soup. - Pick out the vowels? I left in the Y's. Because, "sometimes Y." - And something else. - Saltines? No, $1000 and a football phone. What? Oh, my God! - There's really money in here. - I know. What are you doing? I want you to have it. I don't want it. - I have to give you something. - No, you don't - Do you want my tinfoil hat? - No, you need that. - It's okay. Thanks. - Let me do something. I'll tell you what. Buy me a soda and we're even. Okay? - Okay. - Okay. Keep the change. Thanks, Lizzy. Want a pretzel? - No, I'm fine. Thanks. - See you. A thumb? I know. There it was, just floating.. like this tiny little hitchhiker. Maybe it's a contest. Like "collect all five." - Does anyone wanna see? - No, thanks! Don't do that. Come on! It's worse than the thumb. - This is so unfair. - Why is it unfair? So I have a flaw! Big deal! Joey's knuckle-cracking isn't annoying? Ross, over-pronouncing every word. Monica, who snorts when she laughs. I mean, what the hell is that thing? I accept those flaws. Why can't you accept me for this? Does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody, or just him? I could live without it. Is it a little annoying? Or is it like when Phoebe chews her hair? Don't listen to him. I think it's endearing. Oh, you do, do you? There's nothing wrong with speaking correctly. Indeed there isn't. I should get back to work. Otherwise someone might get what they ordered. The hair comes out and the gloves come off. Ever go out with a guy your friends really like? No. I'm going out with a guy my friends really like. Are we talking about the coyotes here? All right! A cow got through. Can you believe it? It's just, you know what? I just don't feel the "thing." They feel the thing. I don't feel it. Honey, you should always feel the thing. If that's how you feel about the guy, dump him. - It's gonna be really hard. - He'll get over it. No, he'll be fine. It's the other five I'm worried about. - Don't you respect your body? - Don't you see what you're doing? I've had it with your cancer, emphysema and heart disease. The bottom line is, smoking is cool, and you know it. Alan wants to speak to you. Really? He does? Hey, buddy! What's up? She told you about that, huh? Well, yeah. I have one now and then. Well, yeah, now. It's not that Well, that's true. Gee, you know, no one's ever put it like that before. Well, okay. Thanks. God, he's good. - If only he were a woman. - Yeah. Lamb Chop! How old is that sock? If I had a sock on my hand for 30 years, it'd be talking too. I think it's time to change somebody's nicotine patch. - Where's Joey? - Joey ate my last stick of gum.. so I killed him. Do you think that was wrong? - I think he's across the hall. - Thanks. There you go. I'm alive with pleasure now. Phoebe, do you want the rest of that Pop-Tart? Does anyone want the rest of this Pop-Tart? Hey, I might. I'm sorry. The soda people gave me $7000 for the thumb. And on my way over here I stepped in gum. What is up with the universe? - What's going on? - It's just nice when we're together. It's nicer when everyone gets to wear underwear. Please, guys, we have to talk. Wait! I'm getting a deja vu. No, I'm not. - We have to talk. - There it is! Okay, it's about Alan. Speaking of which, tell him we're on for the Renaissance Fair. Before you get into that, there's something you should know. There's really no easy way to say this. I've decided to break up with Alan. Is there somebody else? No, it's just.. you know, things change. People change. We didn't change. So that's it? It's over? Just like that? You let your guard down. You start to care about someone, and.. - I can go on pretending - Okay! No. That wouldn't be fair to me, Alan, or to you. Well, who wants fair? I just want things back, you know, the way they were. - I'm sorry. - Oh, she's sorry. I feel better. I can't believe this! With the holidays coming up. I wanted him to meet my family. I'll meet someone. There'll be other Alans. Yeah, right! - Are you guys gonna be okay? - We'll be fine. We're just gonna need a little time. I understand. - Wow. - I'm really sorry. Yeah, I mean, I'm sorry too. - But I'm a little relieved. - Relieved? Yeah, well, I mean, I had a great time with you. I just can't stand your friends. Remember when we went to Central Park and rented boats? That was fun. He could row like a Viking. So how'd it go? You know. Did he mention us? He says he's really gonna miss you guys. - Rough day, huh? - You have no idea. Come here. - That's it. I'm getting cigarettes. - No! I don't care! I'm weak! I've gotta have the smoke! If you never smoke again, I'll give you $7000. Yeah, all right.

Monica, what is so amazing? I gave up, like, everything. And for what? -You are just like Jack. -Jack from downstairs? No, Jack and the Beanstalk. Ah, the other Jack. Right. He gave up something but then he got those magic beans. And then he woke up and there was this big plant outside of his window, full of possibilities. He lived in a village, and you live in the Village. Okay. But, Pheebs, Jack gave up a cow. I gave up an orthodontist. -Okay, I know I didn't love him. -Oh, see, Jack did love the cow.

Come on, baby, come on. Let's go. Yes! Chandler's one of those repressed guys who you'd have to seduce. I think it's an act. Chandler is more sophisticated than he seems. -You know who's kind of sexy? -Don't. -Ross. -No, guys. Please, he is my brother. I know exactly what you mean. He can be really smooth. Can't you just picture him in bed? I really don't want to. Come on, laugh. Laugh. I remember the moonlight coming in the window, and her face had the most incredible glow.

You slept with Jason? -You had already broken up. -How long? -Just a couple hours. -Oh, that's nice! -Okay, okay, okay, I got one! Anyway, the valentine T om left in your locker was really from me! Excuse me? Hello! Like he was really gonna send you one. She was a big girl! Really? Well, at least big girls don't pee in their pants in seventh grade! I was laughing. You made me laugh! Oh, my God! There he is! There he is! -Where? -Where we've been looking all night. -He's so cute. -George, baby, drop the towel. -Come on, drop the towel. -Drop it. Will you please drop it? Wow!

The rules are on the back of the box. Hello? It's the Visa card people. -Okay. Will you take my place? -All right. This is Rachel. No! Hello? Oh, yeah. No, I know. I haven't been using it much.

                    			Let it go. It's not a big deal. Not a big deal? It's amazing. You reach in, there's one maneuver and bam! A bra. Right out the sleeve. As far as I know, guys don't do anything that comes close. Right? Come on! You guys can pee standing up. We can? Okay, I'm trying that. Know what blows my mind? Women can see breasts anytime they want. You look down, and there they are. How you get any work done is beyond me. I don't get how guys can do so many mean things and not even care. -Multiple orgasms! -There you go. The One With the East German Laundry Detergent Saturday night. The big night! Date night! Saturday night. Saturday night! -No plans, huh? -Not a one! Not even breaking up with Janice? Right, right. Shut up. Chandler, nobody likes breaking up with someone. Except for Kevin Millmore, may he rot in hell. -You just gotta do it. -I know. But it's just so hard. You're sitting there with her. She has no idea. You finally get up the courage to do it. There's that awkward moment when you've handed her the note. You try to run out of the restaurant before she's finished the note. Why do you have to break up with her? Be a man. Just stop calling. If you want, I'll do it with you. She'd feel like we're ganging up on her. You dump Janice, I'll dump T ony. -You're breaking up with T ony? -He's sweet, but it's not fun anymore. I don't know if it's me or his hunger strike, I don't know. Do you want anything else? You had a nutty, chocolate-y, kind of cake-y, pie thing that Nothing. I' m fine. What's wrong? Why so scrunchie? My father wants to give me a Mercedes convertible. That guy, he burns me up. Yeah, it's a Mercedes if I move back home. It was horrible! He called me "young lady. " I hate when my father calls me that. Did he say "You' re not up to this" again? I got the extended version with choruses of  "You'll Never Make it on Your Own. " Hi, Joey. Oh, my God! Angela! Wow! Being dumped by you agrees with her. -Are you gonna go over there? -No. Yeah. No. Okay, but not yet. I don't wanna seem too eager. One Mississippi, two Mississippi three Mississippi. That seems pretty cool. -Hey, Angela. -Joey. You look good. That's because l' m wearing a dress that accents my boobs. You don't say. So, Rachel, what are you doing tonight? Big glamour night. Me and Monica at Launderama. You wanna hear a freakish coincidence? Guess who's doing laundry there too? -Who? -Me! Was that not clear? Why don't? Why don't I just join you both there? Don't you have a laundry room in your building? Yes. I do have a laundry room in my building. But there's a rat problem. Apparently, they're attracted to dryer sheets. They're going in fine, but they're coming out all fluffy. -Anyway, 7-ish? -Sure. -Forget it. I' m with Bob now. -Bob? Who the hell's Bob? Bob is great. He's smart, sophisticated, and he has a real job. You go on three auditions a month and you' re an actor. Bob Come on! We were great together. And not just at the fun stuff, but, like, talking too. Sorry, Joey. You said, " Let's be friends. " So guess what? -What? -We' re just friends. Fine. Fine. Why don't the four of us have dinner tonight? As friends. What "four of us"? You and Bob, and me and my girlfriend  Monica. I' m telling you, this guy's perfect for you. Forget it! Not after your cousin who could belch the alphabet. Come on, this guy's great. His name's Bob. He's Angela's  brother. He's smart, he's sophisticated and he has a real job. I go on three auditions a month and say l' m an actor, but he's -God help us. -What? Ugly Naked Guy is laying kitchen tile. Look, l' m asking a favor here. If I do this for her brother, maybe Angela will come back to me. What's going on? You go out with tons of girls. I know, but Angela's different. She's like one of a kind, like a snowflake or. -Something else like a snowflake? -Yeah, yeah. Look, I made a huge mistake. I never should've broke up with her. Will you help me? Please? Hold on a sec. You need to not touch any of those. Okay, bye. Monica's not coming. It's just gonna be me and Rachel. Hold on, camper. You've thought this through? It's laundry. The thinking-through is minimal. Just you and Rachel? Just you two? This is a date. You're going on a date. -Uh-uh. -Uh-huh. -I haven't done that in a while. -ls it a date if she doesn't know? Yes, absolutely. Saturday night, all rules apply. What are you saying? I should shave again? Pick up some wine? Well, you may wanna rethink the dirty underwear. It's the first time she'll see your underwear. You want it dirty? No. And the fabric softener? Okay, now what is wrong with my Snuggles? What? It says I'm a sensitive, warm kind of guy. You know, like a little fuzzy bear. -I'll pick something else up. -There you go. Thank you. What does Bob look like? Is he tall, short? Yep. -Which? -Which what? -You've never met Bob, have you? -No, but -For all we know, he's horribly -Hey, Joey! Horribly attractive. I'll be shutting up now. Where are they? Where are they? This is nice. We never do anything, just the two of us. Great. Maybe tomorrow we can rent a car, run over some puppies. I don't wanna do that. -Here we go. -Have a good breakup. -Hey, Janice. -My God, I am so glad you called me. I had the most supremely awful day. That's not good. Can I get an espresso and a latte over here? We got the proofs from the shoot with the vegetables. They sucked. I blew off the afternoon. I went shopping. And I got you. I'm looking. I'm looking. I' m looking. -I got you -What? -What? -What did you get me there? I got you these. Bullwinkle socks. -That's sweet. -I knew you had Rockys. You can wear Bullwinkle and Bullwinkle or Rocky and Rocky, or you can mix. Moose and squirrel. Whatever you want. I'm gonna get another espresso. More latte? No, l' m still working on mine. -That's it? -Yeah, it was really hard. -Yeah, the hug looked pretty brutal. -You weren't there. -Sorry. -How are things going? Going? Things are not going. She got me socks. These go with your Rockys. She really cares about you l' m sorry. Coming through. Move. Move! Excuse me! I was kind of using that machine. Yeah, well, now you' re kind of not. But I saved it. I put my basket on top. I'm sorry. Is that your basket? It's pretty. Unfortunately, I don't see suds! What? No suds, no save, okay? What's going on? Nothing. This horrible woman just took my machine. Was your basket on top? -Yeah, but there were no suds. -So? -You know, no suds, no save. -No suds, no Excuse me. Hold on a second! This is my friend's machine. Hey, hey, hey! Her stuff wasn't in it! Hey, hey, hey! That's not the rule, and you know it! All right. Show's over. Nothing to see here. Okay. Let's do laundry. That was amazing! I can't even send back soup. Well, that's because you' re such a sweet, gentle. Do you? Do you? Oh, hey. You must need detergent. -What's that? -Uberweiss. It's new. It's German. It's extra tough! Rach, are you gonna separate those? Oh, God. Am I being a total laundry spaz? Am I supposed to use one machine for shirts and another for pants? Have you never done this before? Well, not myself. But I know other people that have. Okay. You caught me. I'm a laundry virgin. Don't worry. I'll use the gentle cycle. Basically, you wanna use one machine for all your whites. A whole other machine for your colors. And a third for your delicates. That would be your bras and your underpanty things. These are white cotton panties. Would they go with whites or with delicates? That would be a judgment call. He's so cute! Where did you grow up? -Brooklyn Heights. -Cleveland. -How'd that happen? -My God! What? I suddenly had the feeling I was falling. But I'm not. So, you and Angela, huh? -Yep. Pretty much. -You' re a lucky man. Know what I miss most about her? That cute nibbly noise she makes when she eats. Like a happy little squirrel or a weasel. -I never really noticed. -Oh, yeah, yeah. Listen for it. Monica. Monica is great. Yeah, she is. But it's not gonna last. She's too much for me in bed. Sexually. I've gotta tell you, Bob is terrific. Yeah, isn't he? It's great to meet a smart, funny guy who's emotionally older than 8. You know what else? He's unbelievable in bed! My brother never even told me when he lost his virginity. That's nice. You can. It's like pulling off a Band-Aid. Just do it really fast, and then the wound is exposed. Go! Go! Hi, Janice. Here we go. I don't think we should go out anymore. All right. Well, there you go. Stop it, stop it, stop it. This isn't about you. I know! It's about your fear of commitment. I' m not afraid. -Please. -I don't! -I don't! I' m ready to commit anytime. -Really? I know this is gonna sound stupid  but I feel that if I can do this if I can actually do my own laundry there isn't anything I can't do. That does not sound stupid to me. The first time I had to cook for myself after Carol left me I'm sorry, that's all the time we have. Next on Ross. -Uh-oh. -What? Uh-oh. Uh-oh, the laundry's done. It's a song. The laundry song we sing. Uh-oh! The laundry's done -What's the matter? -Nothing. The laundry's done Come on, show me. It's just that you left a red sock with your whites, and now everything's kind of pink. Everything's pink? Except for the red sock, which is still red. Don't be upset. It can happen to anyone. But it happened to me. God, I'm gonna look like a big Marshmallow Peep! What am I doing? My father's right! I can't live on my own. I can't even do laundry! Something went wrong with Underdog and they couldn't inflate his head. So anyway his head is flopping down Broadway, right? And I'm thinking how inappropriate this is. Something's in my eye. Could we check it in the light, please? -Oh, my God! -What? Were we at the same table? It's like cocktails in Appalachia. -They' re close. -Close? Her tongue's in his ear. Like you've never got a little rambunctious with Ross. Joey, this is sick. It's disgusting. It's  not really true' is it? Who's to say what's true? -What were you thinking? -l' m not proud of this, okay? Well, maybe I am a little. -l' m out of here! -Wait! You like him. I want her. He likes you. -Really? -Yeah. If we put our heads together, between the two of us we can break them up. I' m sorry. I can't believe I did this. I couldn't stop laughing at your Norman Mailer story. Waiter? One more plate of chicken wings over here. Here's the thing. We're different. I'm bing, bing, bing. You' re boom, boom, boom. Oh, my God! I' m so sorry! Are you okay? It's just my lens. It's my lens. I'll be right back. I hit her in the eye! In the eye! This is the worst breakup in the history of the world! Oh, my God! -How many have you had? -I don't know. A million! Chandler, easy, easy. Go to your happy place. -l' m fine, l' m fine. -All right. -l' m not fine. Here she is. -Wait here, okay? Breathe. -How do you do that? -It's like a gift. We should always break up together. I'd like that! The clothes are clean. That's the important part. I guess. Except everything looks like jammies now. I'm sorry. Excuse me. We had this cart. I had a 24-inch waist. You lose things. Now, come on. Get out of my way. I' m sorry. Maybe I wasn't being clear. This was our cart. There weren't clothes in it! Hey, hey, hey, hey! Quit making up rules! Let go! Come on, it's my cart. Listen, Mitzi, if you want it you' re gonna have to take me with it! -Yes! Did you see that? -You were incredible. A brand-new woman, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you. I could not have done this without you. More clothes in the dryer? -I'm fine. I'm fine. -Are you sure? -Are you sure you' re okay? -Yeah. -Does it still hurt? -Yeah. What a neat idea! All your clothes match. I' m gonna do this. -How'd it go? -Excellent! We ripped that couple apart and kept the pieces for ourselves. What a beautiful story. -I'm fine, by the way. -I'm sorry. -Where's Chandler? -He needed time to grieve. I' m free! I' m free! That ought to do it.

                    			Oh, look look look! There's Joey's picture! This is so exciting! You can always spot someone who's never seen his one of his plays before. Notice, no fear. No sense of impending doom. "The role of man number three will not be played by Vic Shapiro. " We came on the wrong night. I can't believe I forgot to bring a magazine. -Come on you guys, this might be good. -I don't know. The exclamation point scares me. It's not just Freud, it's Freud! Magic is about to happen! Well, Eva we've done some excellent work here. And I would have to say your problem is quite clear. All you want is a dinkle What you envy's a schwang A thing through which you can tinkle To play with or simply let hang The One With the Butt I feel violated. Did anybody else feel like peeling their skin off to have something else to do? Ross, 1 0:00. Is it? It feels like 2. -No, 1 0:00! -What? There's a beautiful woman at 8, 9, 1 0:00! Hello! She's amazing! She makes the women l dream about look like fat, bald men. Go over. She's not with anyone. And what would my opening line be? Excuse me. Come on, she's a person. You can do it. Could she be more out of my league? Back me up. He couldn't get a woman like that in a million years. You always see these beautiful women with "nothing" guys. You could be one of those guys. -You could do that. -You think? Absolutely! I can't believe I'm considering this. -l' m very aware of my tongue. -Come on. Here goes. Stand back, everyone. Incoming ego shrapnel. All right, I can do this. -Yes? -Hi. Okay, next word would be  Chandler. Chandler is my name and. Hi! Yes, you said that. Yes! Yes, I did. But what I didn't say. What I wanted to say was would you like to go out with me? Thank you. Good night. Chandler? -I didn't know you could dance! -You were in a play! What'd you think? -I didn't know you could dance! -You were in a play! It wasn't that bad. I was the lead. It was better than the troll thing. At least you got to see my head. -You're right. -We saw your head. How about that accent? Yeah. All of your W's were V's. She said yes! Awful play, man! Her name's Aurora. She's ltalian and she pronounces my name " Chandler. " I like that better. The usher gave me this. -What is it? -The Estelle Leonard T alent Agency. An agency left its card. They wanna sign me! Based on this play? Based on this play! Look! There's a note on the back. "Loved your work. Call me a sap. " She was obviously very moved! You should call her fairly quickly. Yeah! As soon as possible! Come in! Hi. I'm here to see Estelle Leonard. Just a moment, let me see if she's in. Hello. -You' re Estelle? -I know you weren't expecting someone so fantastically beautiful. Love lump. T ake a load off already, darling. Sit already. I can't tell you how excited I am to be here. Why not? -What I meant was -You don't mind if I eat, do you? Joey sweetheart, let me ask you a question. Did you ever see the movie Sleepless in Seattle? -Wow! Do you represent those actors? -No. But you know the end, where they' re happy? That's gonna be you and me. You mean you wanna sign me? No, I wanna go to the top of the Empire State Building and make out. Of course I wanna sign you! -Miss Leonard, I'm so -Oh, boy. -Ride them, cowboy. -l' m sorry! I don't see it! -T ry to look through it. -Unfocus your eyes. Focus? There's nothing to focus on. -It's the Statue of Liberty! -Right! -Where's the Statue of Liberty? -There. I can't not see it now. Hey, kids! Come here. Do you see anything here? -lt looks like a boat. -A boat. Right in front of the Statue of Liberty. It's been seven seconds, and you haven't asked me how my date went. How was your date, Chandler? It was unbelievable! I've never met anyone like her. She's had an amazing life! She was in the Israeli army. None of the bullets hit the engine, so we made it to the border. But just barely, and l. I've been talking about myself all night long. I'm sorry. What about you? T ell me a story. All right, once  I got on the subway. And it was at night and I rode it all the way to Brooklyn. Just for the hell of it. We talked until 2:00. It was perfect. More or less. Suddenly, we realized we were in Yemen. I' m sorry, so "we" is? "We" is me and Rick. Who's Rick? Who's Rick? My husband. -Oh, so you' re divorced? -No. I' m sorry. So you' re widowed? Hopefully? No, l' m still married. So, how would your husband feel about you sitting here with me sliding your foot so far up my leg you can count the change in my pocket? Don't worry. He'd be okay with you because he's okay with Ethan. Ethan? There's an Ethan? Ethan is my boyfriend. What? What kind of relationship do you imagine us having if you have a husband and a boyfriend? I suppose, mainly sexual. Sorry it didn't work out. What, not work out? I'm seeing her again on Thursday. Didn't you listen to the story? Didn't you listen? It's twisted! How could you get involved with her? I had trouble with it at first. But I get the good stuff. All the fun, all the talking, all the sex and none of the responsibility. -This is every guy's fantasy! -That's not true! -Ross, is this your fantasy? -No, of course not. Yeah. Yeah, it is. You'd go out with someone going out with someone else? -I couldn't. -Good for you. When l' m with a woman, I need to know  I' m going out with more people than her. Once, I went out with a guy who just got divorced. It was hard. His kids liked me better than him. What does this have to do with Chandler? Nothing. I didn't have anything on that topic. So I went another way. You know, monogamy can be a tricky concept. I mean, anthropologically speaking Fine. Now you'll never know. We' re kidding. T ell us. -We wanna know. -Come on! All right. There's a theory put forth by Richard Leakey Are we greeting each other this way now? I like it. Look! I cleaned! I did the windows. I did the floors. I used all the vacuum attachments but the round one. What's it for? Nobody knows. And we're not supposed to ask. What do you think? -It's very clean. -Really, it looks great! I see you moved the green ottoman. How did that happen? I don't know. It looked better there. And it's an extra seat around the table. Yeah, it's interesting. But you know what? Just for fun Iet's see what it looked like in the old spot. Just to compare. Let's see. Well, it looks good there too. Let's leave it there for a while. I can't believe you moved the green ottoman. Be glad you didn't fan the magazines. She'll scratch your eyes out. -You guys, I am not that bad! -Yeah, you are. Remember, I lived with you? You were a little. That is so unfair! When we were kids, yours was the only Raggedy Ann doll that wasn't raggedy. Okay, so I'm responsible. I'm organized. But hey, I can be a kook! All right, you madcap gal! Imagine this. The phone bill arrives, but you don't pay it right away. -Why not? -Because you're a kook! You wait until they send a notice. I could do that. Okay, then you let me go grocery shopping -No problem. -I'm not done yet. And I buy detergent, but it's not the one with the easy-pour spout. Why would someone do that? One might wonder. But I would be fine with that. A glass is on the table with no coaster. A cold drink. A hot day. Beads of condensation are inching closer to the wood. Stop it! Oh, my God! It's true. Who am l? Monica, you' re Mom. Oh, my God! Okay, I'll be there. That was my agent. My agent has just gotten me a job in the new Al Pacino movie! -That's great! -What's the part? Can you believe it? Pacino! This guy's why I became an actor! " Out of order? You' re out of order! This whole courtroom's out of order! " Seriously, what's the part? "Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in! " Come on. Seriously, Joey, what's the part? You' re. What? I' m his butt double, okay? I play Al Pacino's butt. All right? He goes into the shower, and then  I' m his butt. Oh, my God! Come on, you guys. It's a real Pacino movie and that's big! It's terrific. You deserve this. After years of struggling you've cracked your way into show business. Fine. Make jokes, I don't care. -This is a big break for me! -You' re right. It is. So, will you invite us to the big opening? -I need some moisturizer. -For what? T oday's the big day! You got any tweezers? I think I have a rogue hair. God. Go in the bathroom. Use whatever you want. Don't ever tell me what you did in there. Thank you. -Joey's mom's on the phone. -ln the bathroom. -You don't wanna go in there! -Come on, we' re roommates. My eyes! My eyes! I warned you. Who is being loud? Oh, that would be Monica. Can I borrow stuff? I wanna make Aurora breakfast. You got the whole night? Well, I only have 20 minutes until Ethan, so. Do I sense resentment? No. No resentment. Believe me it's worth it, okay? In a relationship, you have moments you'll remember the rest of your life. Every single second is like that with Aurora. I've just wasted 35 of them talking to you. So, Monica, can you help me with the door? The old Monica would remind you to scrub that T eflon pan with a plastic brush. But l' m not gonna do that. Excuse me? Can they warm it up? I' m concerned about goose bumps. Everybody ready? I wanna thank you for this opportunity. I mean, I know this is just a first step, but I hope that someday Lose the robe. Right. Okay. Losing the robe! Okay, and the robe is lost. I would like to get this in one take. Let's roll it. Water's working. And action! And cut! Butt guy, what are you doing? I'm showering. No, that was clenching. The way I see it, the guy's upset here, you know? His wife's dead, his brother's missing. I think his butt would be angry here. I think his butt would like to get the shot before lunch. Once again, rolling. Water working. And action! And cut! What was that? I was going for quiet desperation. But if you have to ask. God, I love these fingers. Thank you. No, actually, I meant my fingers. Look at them. Look at how happy they are. -Oh, my God, l' m late! -Oh, no! -Don't go. -Okay. -I have to. -Look, she's leaving. I' m sorry. He'll be waiting for me. -I thought you talked to Rick. -It's not Rick. Ethan? He gets the whole day! No, it's Andrew. I know there'll be moments when I'll regret asking the following question, but. -And Andrew is? -He's  new. So you' re not completely fulfilled by Rick, Ethan and myself? No, that's not exactly what I was Most women would kill for three guys like us. -So, what do you want? -You. -You have me. -No. Just you. -What do you mean? -Lose the other guys. Like, all of them? Come on, we' re great together. Why not? Can't we have what we have now? Why can't we talk and make love without feeling obligated to each other? Up until tonight, I thought that's what you wanted too. Well, part of me wants that  but it's like l' m two guys. One guy's saying, "This is great! " But there's this other guy. The guy who wells up when the Grinch's heart grows and breaks that measuring device. He's saying, you know, "This is too hard. Get out! " So, which one of the guys will you listen to? I have to listen to both. They don't let each other finish. Which one? The second guy. I see. Call me if you change your mind. Sorry, the first guy runs the lips. Look at it this way. You dumped her! Right? I mean, this woman was unbelievably sexy and beautiful, intelligent, unattainable. T ell me why you did this again? Movie star! Wait! Aren't you the guy who plays the butt in the new Pacino movie? Nope. No? What happened, big guy? Big guy? It felt like a "big guy" moment. I got fired! They said I acted too much with it. I told everybody about this! -Everybody's expecting to see me. -lKnow what? -No one will be able to tell. -My mom will. There's something so sweet and disturbing about that. I've done crappy plays for six years and I finally get my shot, and I blow it! Maybe this wasn't it. I think when it's your shot, you know it's your shot. Did it feel like your shot? Hard to tell. I was naked. I don't think this was it. I don't think you just get one. I believe things are gonna happen for you. I do. You've got to think about the day some kid will go: "l got the part! I'm gonna be Joey T ribbiani's ass! " You think? That's so nice. I' m sorry, Joey. I' m gonna go to bed, guys. -Good night. -Good night. You' re gonna leave your shoes out here? Really? Just casually strewn about in that reckless, haphazard manner? It doesn't matter. I'll get them tomorrow. Or not! Whenever. She is a kook. If it bothers you that much, just go out and get the shoes. No, don 't do this! This is stupid! I don 't have to prove anything. I'm gonna get them. But then everyone will know. Unless I get them, then wake up really early and put them back. I need help! -All you want is a dinkle -Not that song! -All you envy's a schwang -Come on, you guys. A thing through which you can tinkle Or play with or simply let hang All you want is a dinkle What you envy's a schwang A thing through which you can tinkle Or play with or simply let hang

                    			Everybody! Central Perk is proud to present the music of Miss Phoebe Buffay. Thanks. I wanna start with a song that's about that moment when you suddenly realize what life is really all about. Okay, here we go. Okay. Thank you very much. Oh, great. This is just The One With The Blackout This is so cool, you guys. The entire city's blacked out. It's all of Manhattan. They have no idea when it's back on. -You guys, this is big. -Pants and a sweater. Why, Mom? Who will I meet in a blackout? Power-company guys? Eligible looters? -Can we talk about this later? Okay. -Can I borrow the phone? I wanna call my apartment and check on my grandma. What's my number? I never call me. Oh, my God! It's her. It's that Victoria 's Secret model. Something Goodacre. Hi, Mom, it's Jill. She 's right. It's Jill. Jill Goodacre. Oh, my God! I am trapped in an A TM vestibule with Jill Goodacre. Is it a vestibule? Maybe it's an atrium. Yeah, that is the part to focus on, you idiot. I' m fine. I' m just stuck at the bank in an ATM vestibule. Jill says vestibule, I'm going with vestibule. I' m fine. No, l' m not alone. I don't know, some guy. Oh, some guy. I am some guy. Jill, I saw you with some guy last night. Yes, he was some guy. Hey, everyone. Officiating at tonight's blackout is Rabbi T ribbiani. Chandler's old roommate was Jewish. These are our only candles. So happy Hanukkah! Look! Ugly Naked Guy lit a bunch of candles. That had to hurt! All right, all right! It's been 14 1/2 minutes and you still haven 't said one word. God! Do something! Just make contact. Smile! There you go. You 're definitely scaring her. Hello? Oh, hi, Mom. Mom. Mom, you' re tripping! Dexter's a dog. The blackout's scaring him. You'd pee in Dad's shoes too if you didn't know. All right, call me back. -Mothers. -Yeah. Attaboy! A word. That wasn 't so hard. Mothers. Yeah! Mothers. Yeah! Perfect. Don 't smile. Would you like to call somebody? Yeah, about 300 guys I went to high school with. Yeah, thanks. -Hello? -It's me. -It's Chandler. Are you okay? -Yeah, l' m fine. I' m stuck in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre. -What? -l' m stuck in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre. I have no idea what you said. Put Joey on the phone. -What's up, man? -l' m stuck in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre! Oh, my God! He's trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre! Chandler, listen. Like that thought never entered my mind. -Okay. -Somebody. -I'll go. I'll go. -Okay. Senior year of college, on a pool table. -Pool table? -That's my sister. Okay, my weirdest place would have to be the women's room of the New York City Public Library. Oh, my God! What were you doing in a library? -Pheebs, what about you? -Oh, Milwaukee. It's a really weird place. Ross? Disneyland, 1 989. " It's a small world after all. " No way. The ride broke down so Carol and I went behind those mechanical Dutch children. We were asked never to return to the Magic Kingdom. Let's see, that leaves. -Rachel? -Come on, I already went. -You did not go. -I did. T ell us. Come on. All right, the weirdest place would have to be the foot of the bed. -Step back! -We have a winner! This must be what the fridge looks like with the door closed. Spooky. Anybody hungry? We got a Klondikesoup. I've never had a relationship with that kind of passion. Where you have to have somebody even in a theme park. It was the only thing to do that didn't have a line. Barry wouldn't even kiss me on a miniature golf course. -Come on. -No. He said we held up the people behind us. You didn't marry him because? Do you think there are people that go through life  never having that kind of? -Probably. -Really? I'll tell you something. Passion is way overrated. -Yeah, right. -lt is. Eventually, it kind of burns out. But hopefully what you're left with is trust and security and. In my ex-wife's case, lesbianism. For those people who miss out on that passion thing there's other stuff. -Okay. -But I don't think that'll be you. -You don't? -See, I see - big passion in your future. -Really? -You do? -I do. Ross, you' re so great. It's never gonna happen. -What? -You and Rachel. What? Me and Ra? Why not? You waited too long to make your move and now you' re in the "friend zone. " -l' m not in the zone. -No, Ross. You' re mayor of the zone. Look, l' m taking my time, all right? I' m laying the groundwork. Every day I get a little bit closer to Priesthood! I'm telling you, she has no idea what you're thinking. She just ran her fingers through my hair. -Were you missing that interaction? -No, no, no. This is running fingers through your hair, okay? Now this is a tousle. If you don't ask her out soon, you'll be in the zone forever. I will, I will. I'm waiting for the right moment. What? -What, now? -Yeah. What's messing you up? The wine? The moonlight? You gotta go up to her and say, " Look, Rachel, l" -What? -We' re shushing  because we' re trying to hear something. -What? What? -Don't you hear that? See? -Would you like gum? -ls it sugarless? -Sorry, it's not. -Then no, thanks. What was that? Mental note: If Jill Goodacre offers you gum, you take it. If she offers you mangled animal carcass, you take it! New York City has no power And the milk is getting sour But to me it is not scary Because I stay away from dairy -Here goes. -You'll do it? -I'll do it. -Want help? You come out, you' re a dead man. -Good luck, man. -Thanks. -Okay. -Okay. Where you going? You can't go out there. -Why not? -Because of the reason. -That would be? -I can't tell you. Joey, what's going on? You gotta promise you'll never tell Ross that I told you. -What? -He's planning your birthday party. -Oh, my God! I love him! -You better act surprised. -About what? -My surprise party. -What surprise party? -Oh, stop it. Joey already told me. He didn't tell me. Don't look at me. This is Ross' thing. This is typical. I'm always the last to know. You are not. We tell you stuff. I was the last one to know when Chandler got bit by the peacock. I was the last to know you had a crush on Joey. What? Looks like I was second to last. You had a crush on me? All right. It wasn't a crush, it was a dent. Big dent? You were moving your furniture. I thought you had nice arms. Nice arms, huh? Hey, Mon, l' m moving the chair. Do anything for you? With all the lights out you can actually see the stars. It's so nice. I have a question. Actually, it's not so much a question. It's more of a general wondering. ment. -Okay. -Okay. Here it goes. Well, for a while now, I've been wanting to. -Yes, that's right. -Look at that little kitty! What? Top of the world Looking down on creation And the only explanation I can find Is the love that I found Ever since you 've been around All right, this is just Bactine. It won't hurt. -Ow! -Sorry, that was wax. Poor little T ooty's scared. We should find his owner. Why not put poor T ooty in the hall? During a blackout? She'll get trampled. Yeah? Damage control. Get back to the gum. Gum would be perfection. Gum would be perfection? Gum would be perfection. Could've said, "Gum would be nice. " But, no. For me, gum is perfection. I loathe myself! Oh, no, they' re nuns. They hate all living things. Hi. We just found this cat, and we' re looking for the owner. Yeah, it's mine. -He seems to hate you. Are you sure? -It's my cat. Give me my cat. -Wait a minute. What's his name? -Bob Buttons. -Bob Buttons? -Bob Buttons. Here, Bob Buttons. You are a very bad man! You owe me a cat. Here, kitty, kitty, kitty. Here, kitty, kitty. Where did you go, little kitty? IKitty, kitty, kitty. Come here, kitty, kitty. -Hi. -Buona sera. Wow! Mon, wanna go for a ride in my racecar? I'll bring my arms. We can bring my wheelbarrow for your teeth! Come on, lucky sixes! Everybody, this is Paolo. Paolo, I want you to meet my friends. This is Monica -Hi. -and Joey -Hi. -and Ross. Hi. He doesn't speak much English. Monopoly! Look at that! So, where did Paolo come from? Italy, I think. No, I mean tonight. Suddenly, into our lives. That cat turned out to be Paolo's cat. Isn't that funny? That is funny. And Rachel keeps touching him. I looked all over and couldn't find the kitty anywhere. I found him. It was Paolo's cat. Well, there you go. Last to know again. And I'm guessing, this is Paolo? Paolo, this is Phoebe. You betcha! All right. Okay. What next? Blow a bubble. A bubble's good. It's got a boyish charm. It's impish. Here we go. Nice going, imp! It's okay. All I need to do is reach over and put it back in my mouth. Good save! We 're back on track and I'm  chewing someone else 's gum. This is not my gum! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! And now you 're choking. You all right? My God! You' re choking! -Better? -Yes. Thank you. That was. -That was. -Perfection? That was no tousle. -What'd he say that was so funny? -I have absolutely no idea. That's classic. My God, you guys! What am I doing? This is so un-me! If you want, I'll do it. I just wanna bite his bottom lip. But I won't. The first time he smiled at me those seconds were more exciting than weeks with Barry. Did you rent mopeds? Because I've heard Oh, it's not about that right now. I know it's superficial, and we have nothing in common and we don't even speak the same language, but, God! -Paolo, hi. -Ross. Listen. Listen, something you should know. Rachel and I are. We' re kind of a thing. -Thing? -Thing. Yes, thing. -You have the sex? -No. No, technically the sex is not being had. But that's. But that's not the point. The point is that Rachel and I should be. Well, Rachel and l should be together. And if you get in the -ln bed -No. No, not where I was going. If you get in the way of us becoming a thing then I would be, well, very sad. So, do you? -So you do know a little English? -Little. -Do you know the word "crap-weasel "? -No. That's funny. You are a huge crap-weasel. We've been doing this for an hour. It's easy. Ready? Okay? Now try it. You gotta whip it. Look, look. The last candle's about to burn out. T en, nine, eight, seven  minus 46, minus 47, minus 48. -Thank you. -Thanks. IKind of spooky without any lights. Okay, guys, I have the definitive one. This probably isn't the best time to bring it up but you have to throw a party for Monica. -This has been fun. -Yes. Thanks for letting me use your phone and for saving my life. Well, goodbye, Chandler. I had a great blackout. See you. Hi, l' m account number 71 43457. I don't know if you got that  but I would really like a copy of the tape.

                    			Hey, gorgeous! How's it going? Dehydrated Japanese noodles under fluorescent lights. Does it get better than this? Question: Are you dating anyone? I met somebody who would be perfect for you. Perfect might be a problem. Had you said codependent or self-destructive. -You want a date Saturday? -Yes, please. He is cute. -He's funny. He's -He's a he? Well, yeah. Oh, God! I just You' re nice Oh, God. Good, Shelly. I' m gonna flush myself down the toilet now. Okay. Bye-bye. The One Where Nana Dies Twice It's hard to enjoy noodles after that. Is that ridiculous? Can you believe she actually thought that? Yeah. When I first met you, I thought maybe  possibly you might be. You did? You spent Phoebe's birthday party talking to my breasts so I figured maybe not. Did any of the rest of you guys think that when you first met me? -I did. -I think so, yeah. -Not me. -No, no, me neither. Although back in college, Susan Saladore did. You' re kidding. -Did you tell her I wasn't? -No. I wanted to go out with her too. I told her you were seeing Bernie Spellman who also liked her. Well, this is fascinating. So what is it about me? I don't know. You' re smart, you' re funny. So is Ross. Ever think that about him? -Yeah, right! -What is it? I don't know. You just You have a quality. -Yes, exactly. -Yeah, a quality. "A quality. " Good. I was worried you were gonna be vague about this. I think this is gonna work for you. -Excuse me? -Sure, sure. Women find you less threatening, they let their guards down you' re like a stealth heterosexual. -It's Paolo calling from Rome. -Oh, my God! Calling from Rome! So he's calling from Rome. I could do that. Just gotta go to Rome. Your Dad just beeped in. Can you make it quick? I'm talking to Rome. I'm talking to Rome. Hey, Dad. What's up? Oh, God. Ross, it's Nana. -How you doing? -Hey, Dad. So how is she doing? The doctor says it's a matter of hours. -How are you, Mom? -Me? I' m fine, fine. I' m glad you' re here. -What's with your hair? -What? -What's different? -Nothing. Oh, maybe that's it. -She's unbelievable. Her mother's -Okay, relax. We' re gonna be here a while. We still have boyfriends and your career to cover. Oh, God! The fuzzy little mints at the bottom of her purse. Yeah, they were gross. You know what I love? Her Sweet 'N Lows. How she was always stealing them from restaurants. Not just from restaurants, from our house. Mrs. Geller? She looks so small. I know. Well, at least she's with Pop-Pop and Aunt Phylis now. Aunt Phylis is dead? Yeah, for like six years. Where were? Can we focus, please? Goodbye, Nana. Bye, Nana. Nurse! What is going on? You know how the nurse said Nana had passed? Well, she's not quite. What? She's not passed! She's present! She's back! What's going on? She may have died. She may have died? We're looking into it. I'll go see. This almost never happens. Now she's passed. I just have to know, okay? Is it my hair? Yes, that's exactly what it is. It's your hair. Yeah, you have homosexual hair. So did she? Twice. -Twice? -Oh, that sucks. -You guys okay? -I don't know. It's weird. I know she's gone, but I just don't feel. Maybe she's not really gone. No, no, she's gone. We checked. A lot. No, I mean, maybe no one ever really goes. Ever since my mom died, every now and then  I get this feeling that she's right here, you know? And Debbie, my friend from junior high got struck by lightning on a miniature golf course. I always get this strong Debbie vibe when I use a little yellow pencil. -I miss her. -Here, Pheebs. Want this? -Oh, thanks. -Sure. I just sharpened her this morning. I don't believe any of that. When you' re dead you' re dead. You' re gone. You' re worm food. So Chandler looks gay, huh? I don't know who this is, but it's not Debbie. Dad, let's just make a decision. You're right. It's going into the ground. We should get the most basic thing. "The non-protective corrugated fiberboard with white laminate. " Dad, we can't bury Nana in a dresser from kea. This is why your mother buys my clothes. I hate to shop. I hate it. Isn't this more about the fact that once you decide, it's like acknowledging Nana's actually gone? No, I really hate to shop. -I thought it'd be a closed casket. -lt doesn't mean she can't look nice. Sweetie, you think you can get in there? I don't see why not. Here's my retainer. I was just thinking -when my time comes -Dad. Listen to me. When my time comes, I wanna be buried at sea. You what? I wanna be buried at sea. It looks like fun. Define "fun. " Come on. You'll make a day of it. You'll get a boat, pack a lunch. And then we throw your body in the water. Gee, that does sound fun. Everyone thinks they know me. Everyone says I'm so predictable. Maybe after I'm gone, they'll say, " Buried at sea? Huh? " That's probably what they'll say. I'd like that. -Hey, gorgeous. -Hey. Look, l' m sorry about yesterday. Don't worry. Apparently, other people have made the same mistake. Okay. Phew! So, what do you think it is about me? I don't know what. You just have -a quality. -A quality. Great. It's a shame. You and Lowell would've made a great couple. Lowell? Financial Services Lowell? That's who you saw me with? What? He's cute. Well, yeah. He's no Brian in Payroll. Is Brian? I don't know. If you were gonna set me up  I'd like to think it'd be with somebody like him. Brian's a little out of your league. Excuse me. You don't think I could get a Brian? Because I could get a Brian. Believe you me. I'm really not. This one? I've shown you every dress we have. Unless you want her to spend eternity in a lemon-yellow pantsuit go with the burgundy. Whatever we pick, she'd say it's the wrong one. Right. We'll go with the burgundy. A fine choice. I'm coming out. Wait! We need shoes. -How about these? -That's really a day shoe. Where she's going everyone else will be dressier? Could we see something in a slimmer heel? I have nothing in an evening shoe in the burgundy. I can show you something silver that may work. -No, it really should be burgundy. -Unless we go with a different dress. No, no, no. Watch this. Wait, I may have something in the back. Oh, my God. Is everything all right? Just Nana's stuff. You guys ready? Mom called to tell me not to wear my hair up. -Know my ears aren't my best feature? -Some days it's all I can think about. I' m sorry l' m late. I couldn't find my bearings. You mean your earrings? What did I say? -Are these the shoes? -Yes. Paolo sent them from ltaly. What? We don't have shoes here? -Morning. We ready to go? -Don't we look nice all dressed up? It's stuff like that, isn't it? -lt was a really beautiful service. -lt really was. Come here, sweetheart. You know, I think it's time for you to start using night cream. What? Nothing. Just that your coat sounds like Brent Musberger. -Check it out. Giants-Cowboys. -You're watching football at a funeral? No, it's the pre-game. I' m gonna watch it at the reception. You're a frightening, frightening man. Oh, no! My new Paolo shoes! I hope they're not ruined. God, what a great day! What? Weather-wise. I know. The air, the trees. Even though Nana's gone, there's something almost life Ross, are you okay? No, l' m fine. Just  having my worst fear realized, but. I' m just checking to see if the muscle's in spasm. -What? What is it? -You missed a belt loop. Okay, it's in spasm. Here, sweetie. I took these when I had my gall thing accident. Thanks, Mom. Sorry. Hi, l' m Andrea. I'm Dorothy's daughter. Hi, I'm Chandler, and I have no idea who Dorothy is. Look who's up! -How do you feel? -I feel great. I feel great. I feel great. Wow, those pills really worked. Yeah. Not the first two, but the second two. I love you guys. You guys are the greatest. I love my sister. I love Pheebs. That's so nice. I love you, man. And listen, if you wanna be gay, be gay! It doesn't matter to me. You were right. I do love you. Oh, Ross. I love you too. Oh, no, I really love you. I really love you. Oh, you don't get it! -What do you got there? -Just a hearing disability. What's the score? Three minutes to go in the third. Beautiful! Pheebs, could you maybe hand me a cracker? Your grandmother would've hated this. Sure. What with it being her funeral and all. No, I'd be hearing about why didn't I get the honey-glazed ham. Or I didn't spend enough on flowers. Or she'd say: "Why waste your money? I don't need flowers, l' m dead. " That sounds like Nana. Do you know what it's like to grow up with someone who is critical of every single thing you say? I can imagine. It's a wonder your mother turned out to be the positive, life-affirming person she is. That is a wonder. So tell me something, Mom. If you had to do it all over again  I mean, if she was here right now would you tell her? T ell her what? How she drove you crazy, picking on every little detail. Like your hair, for example. I'm not sure I know what you're getting at. Would things have been better if you'd just told her the truth? Some things are better left unsaid. It's nicer when people just get along. More wine? Oh, I think so. Those earrings look really lovely on you. Thank you. They're yours. Actually, they were Nana's. Now l' m depressed! Even more than I was. Oh, look. My first grade picture. Please ignore the Dy-no-mite T -shirt. -Hey, who's this little naked guy? -That little naked guy would be me. Look at the little thing! Yes, fine. That is my penis. Can we be grownups now? Who are those people? -Got me. -That's Nana right there in the middle. Yeah, let's see. " Me and the gang at Java Joe's. " You look just like your grandmother. How old was she? Let's see, " 1 939. " Twenty-four, twenty-five. It looks like a fun gang. Look, look, look! I got Monica naked! Let me see! No, no. That would be me again. I'm just trying something. Hey, Lowell. Oh, hey, Chandler. So how's it going in Financial Services? It's like Mardi Gras without the papier-mache heads. How about you? Good. Good. Listen I don't know what Shelly told you about me, but  I' m not. I know. That's what I told her. Really? So you can tell? Pretty much. Most of the time. We have a kind of radar. So you don't think I have a quality? Speaking for my people, I'd have to say no. By the way, your friend Brian, from Payroll? He is. -He is? -And way out of your league. Out of my league! I could get a Brian. If I wanted to get a Brian, I could get a Brian. Hey, Brian.

                    			Terry, I know I haven't worked here very long but would it be possible if I got a $1 00 advance on my salary? An advance? So I can spend Thanksgiving with my family. Every year we ski in Vail, and my father pays for my ticket. But I've started this independent thing which is actually why I took this "job. " Rachel, Rachel, sweetheart! You' re a terrible, terrible waitress. Really, really awful. I hear what you're saying. I'm with you. But I'm trying really hard, and I think I'm doing better. I really do. -Does anybody need coffee? -Yeah, over here. Look at that. The One Where Underdog Gets Away Excuse me, sir? Hi. You come in here all the time.

Did you know Mom and Dad are going to Puerto Rico for Thanksgiving? -What? No, they're not. -Yes, the Blymans invited them. You' re wrong. -I am not wrong. -You' re wrong. No, I just talked to them. I' m calling Mom. -Hey, hey. -Hey! And this from the Cry for Help Department: Are you wearing makeup? Yes, I am. As of today, I'm officially Joey T ribbiani, actor/model. That's funny. I was thinking you look more like, Joey T ribbiani, man/woman. -What were you modeling for? -Posters for the free clinic. So you' re gonna be one of those healthy guys? -The asthma guy's really cute. -Know which one you'll be? No, but I hear Lyme disease is open, so you know. -Good luck, man. I hope you get it. -Thanks. You were right. How can they do this? It's Thanksgiving! What if I cook dinner at my place? I'll make it just like Mom's. Will you make mashed potatoes with the lumps? They're not actually supposed to I'll work on the lumps. -Joey, you' re going home? -Yeah. Chandler, you' re still boycotting all the pilgrim holidays?

Shoop, shoop, shoop. -Only $1 02 to go. -I thought it was 98. 50? Yeah, well, it was, but l I broke a cup, so. -Well, l' m off to Carol's. -Ooh, ooh, why don't we invite her? Ooh, ooh, because she's my ex-wife and will want to bring her ooh, ooh, lesbian life partner. Hi. Is Carol here? -No, she's at a faculty meeting. -I just came by to pick up my skull. Well, not mine, but. -Come in. -Thanks. Carol borrowed it, and I have to get it back to the museum. -What's it look like? -Kind of like a big face without skin. Yes. I'm familiar with the concept. -We can just look for it. -Okay. Wow, you guys sure have a lot of books about being a lesbian. Well, you know, you have to take a course. Otherwise they don't let you do it. Hey, Yertle the Turtle! A classic. Actually, I'm reading it to the baby. The baby that hasn't been born yet? Wouldn't that mean you're crazy? You don't think they can hear sounds in there? You' re not serious? I mean, you really talk to it? Yeah, all the time. I want the baby to know my voice. Well, that's just Do you talk about me? -Yeah. All the time. -Really? But, we just refer to you as " Bobo the Sperm Guy. " If she's talking to it, I just think I should get some belly time too. Not that I believe this. I believe it. I think the baby can hear everything. -Really? -I'll show you. This'll seem weird. But you put your head inside this turkey and we'll all talk and you'll hear everything we say. I'd just like to say I'm totally behind this experiment. In fact, I'd very much like to butter your head. -Hey. -Rach, did you make your money? No, not even close. Forget Vail. Forget seeing my family. Forget shoop, shoop, shoop. -Rach, here's your mail. -Thanks. You can put it on the table. No. Here's your mail! Thanks. You can put it on the table! Would you just open it! Oh, my God! You guys are great! We all chipped in. -We did? -You owe me $20. Thank you. Thank you so much! Chandler, got your traditional holiday feast. T omato soup grilled-cheese fixings and a family-size bag of Funyuns. This is your Thanksgiving dinner? What is it with you and this holiday? -I'm 9 years old. -I hate this story! We've finished this magnificent Thanksgiving dinner. I have a mouthful of pumpkin pie. And then my parents tell me they're getting divorced. Oh, my God! Very difficult to enjoy Thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it in reverse. What's this? I never saw this at Mom's. -It's a yam. -Hello. This isn't a yam. Yam comes in purple cans. They don't They don't come in these. Ross, don't take this the wrong way or anything, but back off. Hi. -We used to work together. -We did? Yeah, at Macy's. You' re the Obsession girl, right? -Yes. -I was the Aramis guy. -Aramis. Aramis. Aramis. -Yeah, right! -You' re the best in the business. -Get out. You' re amazing! You know when to spritz. You know when to lay back. Really? You don't know what that means to me. You smell great tonight. What are you wearing? Nothing. -Listen, do you wanna go get a drink? -Yeah, that would be -What's wrong? -I have to do something. What? -Leave. -Wait, wait, wait! So I guess you all saw it. -What? -Saw what? No, we' re just laughing. You know how laughter can be infectious. Set another place for Thanksgiving. My entire family thinks I have VD. "T onight, on a very special Blossom. " Looking good! Okay! Cider's mulling, turkey's turkeying, yams are yamming. What? I don't know. It's just not the same without Mom in the kitchen. Get out and stop annoying me! Oh, that's closer. I got the tickets! Five hours from now, shoop, shoop, shoop! -Oh, you must stop shooping. -Okay, l' m gonna get my stuff. Will you come in? I prefer to keep a safe distance from all this merriment. Look out! Incoming pumpkin pie! We laughed when you did it with the stuffing, but that's not funny. Hey, Monica, I got a question. I don't see any T ator T ots. -That's not a question. -My mom makes them. It's a tradition. You get a piece of turkey on your fork, a little cranberry sauce and a T ot! I mean, it's bad enough I can't be with my family because of my disease. All right. Fine. Tonight's potatoes will be mashed, with lumps and in the form of Tots. All right, I'm off to talk to my unborn child. Okay, Mom never hit. Okay, all done. Phoebe, did you whip the pota? Ross needs lumps! Oh, l' m sorry! I just I thought we could have them whipped and then add some peas and onions. Why do that? Because then they'd be just like my mom used to make it, before she died. Okay. Three kinds of potatoes coming up. Okay. Goodbye, you guys! Thanks for everything! Oh, God, look at Sorry! I'm so sorry. An unbelievable thing happened! Underdog got away! -The balloon? -No, no, the actual cartoon character. Of course the balloon! He broke free and was spotted flying over Washington Square Park. -I'm going to the roof. Who's with me? -I can't! An 80-foot dog over the city? How often does that happen? Almost never. -Got the keys? -Okay. Anytime you' re ready. Okay. Okay, here we go. Okay. Where am I talking to here? There is one way that offers a certain acoustical advantage, but. Just aim for the bump. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay, here goes. You know, I can't do this. This is It's too weird. I feel stupid. It's fine. You don't have to do it just because Susan does it. Hello, baby. Hello. Hello. the moment we first saw the dog shadow fall over the park! But did they have to shoot him down? That was just mean. Right now the turkey should be crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. Why are we standing here? We're waiting for you to open the door. You have the keys. No, I don't. Yes, you do. When we left, you said, "Got the keys. " No, I didn't. I asked, "Got the keys? " No, no, no. You said, "Got the keys! " Do either of you have the keys? -The oven is on! -I've gotta get my ticket! -Wait! We have a copy of your key. -Get it! That tone won't make me go any faster. -Joey. -That one will. And everyone's telling me, "You gotta pick a major. " So on a dare, I picked paleontology. And you have no idea what I'm saying, because, face it, you' re a fetus. You're happy you don't have gills anymore. You don't have to talk to it. You can sing Please. I am not singing to your stomach, okay? How's it going? Here we come Walking down the street Get the funniest looks from Everyone we meet Hey, hey -Hey, did you just feel that? -I did. -Does it always? -That was the first. IKeep singing! IKeep singing! Hey, hey, you 're my baby And I can 't wait to meet you When you come out I'll buy you a bagel Then we 'll go to the zoo -lt did it again! -I felt it that time! Hey, hey, I'm your daddy I'm the one without any breasts This is great. It's 5:00. My plane is pulling away from the gate. -Maybe you can take a later flight. -There is none. -You can go tomorrow. -T omorrow is not Thanksgiving! If l' m gonna cheer you up, you have to meet me halfway. Can you go any faster? I got one keyhole and a zillion keys! You do the math. Why do you guys have so many keys in there anyway? For an emergency just like this. All right. Listen, smirky! If not for your stupid balloon, I'd be on a plane watching a woman do this right now. But l' m not! You said you had the keys! No, I didn't! I wouldn't say I had the keys unless I had the keys! That's it! Enough with the keys. No one say keys! Why would I have the keys?! -Aside from the fact you said you did? -I didn't! -You should've. -Why? -Because! -Why? Everything's my responsibility? Isn't it enough that l' m making dinner? Everyone wants a different kind of potato, so I'm making them. Does anybody care what kind of potatoes I want? No! No! No! Just as long as Phoebe gets her peas and onions, and Mario gets his T ots It's my first Thanksgiving, and l It's all burnt, and I can't. Monica, only dogs can hear you now. Look, the door's open. Here we go. -All right, Chandler, don't lose this. -No Well, the turkey's burnt! Potatoes are ruined! Potatoes are ruined! Potatoes are ruined! Here we come Walking down the This doesn't smell like Mom's. It doesn't, does it? You wanted lumps? Here you go, buddy. You got one! -Don't yell at me. You burned dinner! -Hey, don't make her squeak again! God, this is great! The plane is gone. I guess I'm stuck here with you guys. We all had better plans. This was nobody's first choice! Oh, really? So why was I busting my ass to make this delicious dinner? -You call that delicious? -You be quiet! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Now this feels like Thanksgiving. Skiing. Shoop, shoop, shoop. Shoop. -Eww. -What? Ugly Naked Guy's taking his turkey out of the oven. -Who cares? -He just sat in gravy. Oh, my God! He's not alone. Ugly Naked Guy is having Thanksgiving dinner with Ugly Naked Gal. I gotta see this! All right, Ugly Naked Guy! Ugly naked dancing! It's nice that he has someone. Shall I carve? -By all means. -All right. Who wants light cheese, and who wants dark cheese? I don't even want to know about the dark cheese. -Does anybody wanna split this? -I will. -You guys have to make a wish. -Make a wish? Come on, you know, Thanksgiving. You got the bigger half! What did you wish for? The bigger half. All right, I'd like to propose a toast. A little toast here. Ding, ding! This isn't the Thanksgiving you planned but for me, this has been really great. I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. If you'd gone to Vail or if you had been with your family or if you didn't have syphilis and stuff we wouldn't be together. I guess what l' m trying to say is that  I' m very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked. -That's so sweet! -Thank you. -Here's to a lousy Christmas! -And a crappy New Year! -Hear, hear! -Hear, hear!

Why would a parent name their child Bethel? That monkey's got a Ross on his ass. Is he gonna live with you in your apartment? Yeah. It's been kind of quiet since Carol left. Why not get a roommate? You reach a certain age, having a roommate is just kind of pathet That's " pathet. " Sanskrit for " really cool way to live. " The One With the Monkey I' m doing new material tonight. I have 1 2 songs about my mother's suicide and one about a snowman. You might wanna open with the snowman. -Hi, Joey. -Hey, buddy. -So how'd it go? -I didn't get the job. How could you not?

It's just such a slap in the face, you know? Do you know what you' re doing for New Year's? Hey, what? What is wrong with New Year's? You have Paolo. You don't have to face the pressure of finding lips to kiss when the ball drops! Man, I'm talking loud! Paolo's gonna be in Rome this New Year's. -I'll be just as pathetic as you. -Yeah, you wish. I've got an idea. Dinner. It's perfect. We'll put it between lunch and breakfast. I'm sick of being a victim of this Dick Clark holiday. I say this year, we make a pact. Just the six of us. Dinner. -Sure. -Fine. I was hoping for more enthusiasm. -Phoebe, you' re on. -Oh, good. Hi. Ladies and gentlemen, back by popular demand  Miss Phoebe Buffay. Hi. Thanks. Hi. I wanna start with a song that means a lot to me. I made a man with eyes of coal And a smile so bewitching How was I supposed to know That my mom was dead in the kitchen? My mother's ashes Even her eyelashes Are resting in a little yellow jar And sometimes when it's freezing I feel a little sneezy And now I Excuse me? Excuse me? Yeah, noisy boys. Is it something you'd like to share with the group? No. No, that's okay. If it's important enough while I'm playing it's important enough for everyone else. That guy's going home with a note. -I was just saying -Speak up. Sorry, l I was saying you were the most beautiful woman I'd ever seen. And he said that Daryl Hannah was the most beautiful woman he'd ever seen. I said I liked her in Splash, but not Wall Street. I thought she had a hard quality. While Daryl is beautiful in a conventional way you are luminous with a kind of delicate grace. Then that's when you started yelling. We're gonna take a short break. That guy's going home with more than a note. Come here, Marcel. Sit here. I can't believe he hasn't kissed you yet. By my sixth date with Paolo, he'd already named both my breasts. Did I just share too much? Just a smidge. David's, like, a scientist guy. He's very methodical. -I think it's romantic. -Me too! Did you ever see An Officer and a Gentleman? He's kind of like the guy I went to see that with. Except he's smarter and gentler and sweeter. I just wanna be with him all the time. You know, day and night. And night and day. And special occasions. I see. You're gonna ask him to New Year's. -She's gonna break the pact. -No! No, no. No. Yeah, could I just? -Yeah. I already asked Janice. -What? This was a pact! This was your pact! I couldn't handle the pressure. I snapped! But that was the worst breakup in history! I'm not saying it was a good idea. I snapped! Hi, sorry I'm late. Too many jokes. Must mock Joey. Nice shoes, huh? God, you're killing me! Ross, he's playing with my spatulas again! -He's not gonna hurt them, right? -Do you always have to bring him? I didn't wanna leave him alone. We had our first fight this morning. It has to do with my working late. I said some things that I didn't mean. He threw some feces. If you're working late, I can look in on him. That would be great! But make sure it seems like you're there to see him. You're not doing it for me. Okay. But if he asks, I'm not going to lie. But you can't actually test this theory. T oday's particle accelerators aren't powerful enough -to simulate these conditions. -I have a question then. -Yeah? -Do you plan on kissing me ever? That's definitely a valid question, and the answer would be yes. Yes, I was. But I wanted it to be this phenomenal kiss at a phenomenal moment because it's you. Sure. The longer I waited, the more phenomenal the kiss had to be. Now, it's just gotta be one of those things where l sweep everything off the table. And I'm not really a sweeping sort of fella. David, I think you are a sweeping sort of fella. I mean, you're a sweeper trapped inside a physicist's body. -Really? -I'm sure. You should just do it. Just throw me. -Now? -Yeah, right now. Just. Okay. Okay. Okay. You know what? This is really expensive. And this was a gift. -Now you' re just tidying up. -Okay. -You want me to throw you? -I can hop. T ell me something, what does " no-date pact" mean to you? It's just that Chandler and Phoebe have somebody. I thought I'd ask Fun Bobby. -Your ex-boyfriend? -Yeah. -You know more than one Fun Bobby? -I happen to know a Fun Bob. -Okay. Here we go. -There's no room for milk. There. Now there is. So on our no-date evening, three of you now have dates. -Four. -Five. Sorry. Paolo's catching an earlier flight. And I met this really hot single mom at the store. What's an elf to do? So I'll be the only one alone when the ball drops? We'll have a big party, and no one will know who's with who. I'll know. This is so not what I needed right now. -What's the matter? -Oh, it's Marcel. He's angry with me. I have no idea why. He keeps shutting me out. He's walking around all the time, dragging his hands. That's weird. I had a blast with him. -Really? -We played, watched TV. That juggling thing is amazing. What juggling thing? With the socks? I figured you taught him that. No. It wasn't that big a deal. Just socks. And a melon. -Phoebe! -Max. Do you know everybody? No. Have you seen David? He hasn't been around. If you see him, tell him to pack. We are going to Minsk. -Minsk? -Minsk. It's in Russia. I know where Minsk is. We got the grant. Three years, all expenses paid. And if you're gonna do Minsk, that's the way to go. -So when do you leave? -January 1 st. -Hello? -What? Hey. Hi. -What are you doing here? -Max told me about Minsk. Congratulations! This is so exciting! It'd be even more exciting if we were going. Oh, you're not going? Oh, why? T ell her. " I don't wanna go to work with Lipson, Yamaguchi and Flank. I wanna stay and make out with my girlfriend! " Okay, thank you, Max. Thank you. So you're really not going? I don't know what I'm gonna do. I just. How can I leave you? I just found you. Oh, David. But what are you gonna do? I don't know. You decide. -Don't do that. -But l' m asking you. -I can't make a decision. Just -Okay. Stay. -Stay. -Stay. Getting so good at that! It was Max's stuff. I love this artichoke thing. Don't tell me what's in it. The diet starts tomorrow. You remember Janice. Vividly. -How are you? -I am fantastic. Now. It's amazing. We've been back together for what -Iike 1 0 minutes, and -ls that all? It's like we were never apart. Of course, we were, but Forgive and forget. Well, forget. -Hi. -Hi, l' m Sandy. Sandy, hi. Come on in. -You brought your kids. -Yeah. That's okay, right? -Party! -That thing is not coming in here! This is how you greet guests? If I showed up with my new girlfriend, she wouldn't be welcome? Your new girlfriend wouldn't urinate on my coffee table. He was more embarrassed about that than anyone. And for him to have the courage to walk back in here Iike nothing happened All right. All right. Just keep him away from me. Thank you. Come on, Marcel. What do you say you and I mingle? All right, I'll catch up with you later. Oh, my gosh! Rachel, honey, are you okay? -Where's Paolo? -Rome. Jerk missed his flight. And then your face exploded? No. Okay. I was at the airport getting into a cab when this woman, this blond planet with a pocketbook starts yelling. Something about how it was her cab first. The next thing, she just starts pulling me out by my hair! And I was blowing my attack whistle thingy and three more cabs show up. So as I'm going to get into a cab, she tackles me! And I hit my head on the curb and cut my lip on my whistle. Everybody having fun at the party? -Are people eating my dip? -Yes. There. -That looks okay, right? -You went a bit wide on the lipstick. -Oh, I did? -Yeah. It's hard for me to tell. My eye's closing up. Let me get it for you. -Ow! -Okay. You know what? It looks fine. Okay, here we go. Screw Paolo, screw the psycho cab lady. It's New Year's Eve. Let's have a good time. -Okay, here we go. -Okay. All right, there you go. This way. Here you go. When I saw you at the store last week it was the first time I ever mentally undressed an elf. -Wow, that's dirty. -Yeah. Hey, kids. He doesn't have to spend the whole evening with me  but at least check in. There you are! You got away from me. -But you found me. -Here, Ross, take our picture. Smile. You' re on Janice Camera. Kill me. Kill me now. Hi, l' m Rachel. So whose friend are you? Look at me, spilling everywhere. Everybody, it's Fun Bobby! Hey, sorry I'm late. But my grandfather died about two hours ago. But I couldn't get a flight out till tomorrow, so here I am. Hey, Fun Bobby! How's it going, man? Whoa! Who died? It's gonna be an open casket, you know? So at least I'll get to see him again. Bobby? Fun Bobby? Let me talk to you for just a sec. I recently lost a grandparent myself so I really know exactly how you feel. But you' re really bringing the party down. -l' m sorry. -Yeah, yeah, okay. There you go. There you go. I' m gonna blow this one up and write " Reunited " in glitter. All right, Janice, that's it! Janice. Janice. Hey, Janice, when I invited you, I didn't think it meant Oh, no! I' m sorry you misunderstood. You listen to me! You listen to me! One of these times, it's just gonna be your last chance with me! Will you give me the thing? -Hi, Max. -Yoko. I've decided to go to Minsk without you. -Wow. -lt won't be the same  but it will still be Minsk. Happy New Year. -Are you all right? -Yeah, l' m fine. I' m fine. Come on. -You' re going to Minsk. -No, l' m not going to Minsk. You are so going to Minsk. You belong in Minsk. You can't stay here just for me. If I go, I have to break up with you. -And I can't break up with you. -Yes, you can. Just say, " Phoebe, I love you, but my work is my life. That's what I have to do. " And I say, "Your work? How can you say that? " Then you say, " I have no choice. Can't you understand that? " And I say, " No! No! I can't understand that! " -Ow. -Sorry. And then you put your arms around me. -Then you put your arms around me. -Oh, sorry. And then you tell me you love me and you'll never forget me. I'll never forget you. Then you say that you have to go  because you don't wanna start the year with me if you can't finish it. I' m gonna miss you, you scientist guy. Hi, Dick Clark in Times Square. We're in a virtual snowstorm of confetti here in Times Square. It gets better every. Here you go, kids. And then the peacock bit me. Please kiss me at midnight! -You seen Sandy? -I don't know how to tell you this  but she's in the bedroom getting it on with Max. Oh, I did know how to tell you. -Hey, everybody, the ball is dropping. -What? The ball is dropping! In 20 seconds, it'll be midnight. And the moment of joy is upon us. Looks like that no-date pact worked out. Everybody looks so happy. I hate that! Not everybody is happy. Hey, Bobby! four, three, two one! Happy New Year! I thought I'd throw this out. I' m no math whiz  but I do believe there are three girls and three guys right here. I don't feel like kissing anyone tonight. -I can't kiss anyone. -So, I'm kissing everyone? No, you can't kiss Ross. That's your brother. So now everybody's getting kissed but me. Somebody kiss me. Somebody kiss me! It's midnight! Somebody kiss me! All right! All right! There! I wanted this to work so much. I'm still in there. Changing his diapers. Picking his fleas. But he's just phoning it in. It's hard that something you love so much doesn't love you back. I think that bitch cracked my tooth.
