B00EQ239NI,MegaGear-Protective-Leather-Cyber-shot-DSC-RX100,"MegaGear Protective Leather Brown Camera Case, For Sony Cyber-shot DSC-RX100 V, DSC-RX100 IV with 24-70mm Lens, DSC-RX100 III, DSC-RX100 II","Bought this for the Sony RX100M3. It's a perfect fit, except the lens makes the camera too thick for comfort. So, XActo knife! I cut out a semi-circle for the lens--now it's ideal! The wrap-around flap still completely protects the camera, and the stick-out lens makes it easy to get the camera out when the flap is lifted.,I've tried a number of other cases, but this is the best. I like a belt case, and this has the loop. I wear it rearward of the right hip, and it sits in a spot where it's hard to see front on, yet easy to access. Sweet spot that does not interfere with sitting in a chair or car seat.,Only improvement, to my mind, would be a real snap instead of a magnetic one. The magnetic one is pretty good, but sometimes comes undone when putting on a seat belt, etc. Still, the flap keeps the camera securely in the case even when un-snapped.,Quality material & workmanship. I preferred a darker color, so wiped it down with black shoe dye, the rubbed with a cloth to get a darker brown antique-y look.","July 18, 2014",5.0 out of 5 stars,Big Max

Nice tanned leather; the strap matches the case (another reviewer said his didn't, but the set I got match perfectly).  A matching leather wrist strap is also included; it's a bit thicker than the nylon one that comes with the camera, and matches the case.  The case also has a leather-covered belt clip.  All I wanted was something to protect the camera, which I always keep in my briefcase or flight bag, and this is perfect.  The straps and belt clip might be useful to others.","May 9, 2014",5.0 out of 5 stars,Aerieudite

Love the width-wise case, the combination of soft suede interior and durable leather exterior, the slightly lowered sides that allow the wrist strap to hang out, and especially the magnetic closure. Only reason I didn't give five stars was that the magnet part of the closure pulled out of the bottom of the case. After putting it back in a few times by reinserting the tabs, it broke. A testament to the quality of the leather work is that the metal broke before the leather gave way. I'll be ordering another if I can't successfully epoxy the closure back in.","November 2, 2016",4.0 out of 5 stars,Darryn W.

Don't expect leather for this price it is vinyl. but I don't dare.  I am not buying a fashion accessories I simply want a protective case for camera.  I wanted a belt loop so when hiking, walking or bike riding I would have the camera ready.

I was looking for this case in the lighter, camel brown that some of the other Mega Brands cases are in, but I settled for this darker one.  When the case arrived, I was surprised to see that I had gotten a camel colored one!

It almost looked like one of those little clasp purses that you see women with at parties, so I wasn't interested in it for that reason alone.,Then, my Sony RX-100 m2 didn't fit very well.

B00OO6RL4E,MegaGear-Neoprene-Carabiner-PowerShot-Digital,MegaGear ''Ultra Light'' Neoprene Camera Case Bag with Carabiner for Canon PowerShot SX60 HS Digital Camera (Gray),"I got this to protect the camera when it was not in the bag I got for it, but I don't be using it.  It fits neatly, and it is light weight, but you have to take the case completely off in order to use the camera, and I found that hard to do without turning on the camera prematurely while taking it out, and again while putting it back.  Also, I would have to take off the lens hood in order to fit the camera into the case.  I have a neoprene case for my digital Rebel, and it attaches to the camera using a screw that fits the tripod connector on the bottom.  To use the camera, all I have to do is flip the case open.  I was hoping that was the way this camera case would work, but alas...","March 5, 2016",3.0 out of 5 stars,Kindle Customer

I read the measurements for this product and compared it to my camera measurements and it was very close so I took a shot and it's exactly what I've been looking for - fits snug around it to be able to throw it in a bag or purse for the day with some protection without having to lug around my entire camera bag. Most generic cases like this for DSLRs are much bigger than my D5500, I've tried a couple and been very disappointed so I am very happy with this purchase!","February 3, 2016",5.0 out of 5 stars,Stephanie
B00OO6RL4E,MegaGear-Neoprene-Carabiner-PowerShot-Digital,MegaGear ''Ultra Light'' Neoprene Camera Case Bag with Carabiner for Canon PowerShot SX60 HS Digital Camera (Gray),"Got this for my SL1. It's about 0.5"" too wide on the right side of the camera and 1""+ too long in the front with my 24mm pancake lens on, but the camera doesn't move around much inside. Overall a pretty decent fit. I think the looseness would make it easier and quicker for me to grab my camera from the sleeve when in my purse. I bought the pink, and it does not have the black rubber logo. It has the brand printed in white on the front.","January 26, 2016",4.0 out of 5 stars,Angry Islander

Solid build also picture and video is excellent. Only 3 things I can see so far that are cons. In the sun and recording or charging it can get pretty hot. But that can be fixed. Battery life isnt that great, especially when recording in 4K. But as long as you charge with at least 2.4A, it recharges quick. And the last thing is you cant charge while recording. That may be a safty feature to prevent overheating. So extra batteries would be a good idea. Other than those small issues the hero 7 black is pretty awesome.

On a trip, I take a lot of pictures – both of scenery and of food – and I want a camera (and camera case) to be to small enough to wear comfortably (and unobtrusively) around my neck all the time. I was pleased with the size of the G7 X, but found it somewhat difficult to choose a case that I liked for the camera. After spending many hours reading reviews, I decided to order 6 different camera cases to see which suited me best. Note that ALL the cases I ordered claimed to be compatible with the G7 X. Surprisingly, the MegaGear “Ultra Lite” Neoprene camera case was the only one of the six cases to suit my needs – all the other ones were either way too large/bulky OR too small for the camera (I felt like the lens was in danger of being crushed when these cases were closed).,PROS for the MegaGear “Ultra Lite” Neoprene case: 1. the G7 X fit perfectly – secure, but not constrictively snug; 2. the case itself was actually smaller than any of the other cases that I ordered – all the other cases were larger (L x W), but some had a shallower or less forgiving depth; 3. the case was easy to open quickly to allow for fast shots of unexpected photo opportunities; 4. the supplied carabiner secured the case easily to my own neck lanyard (I like a longer lanyard length; 5. the case is lightweight and is a stylish and unobtrusive basic black (but, for those more daring than I, it also comes in hot pink, blue, gray and red).,CONS for the MegaGear “Ultra Lite” Neoprene camera case: none really, once you get used to the Velcro closure. I had originally looked for a case with a top zipper opening, but found the MegaGear’s top flap Vecro closure worked well and was really no more “noisy” than a zipper.,* I am pleased with my purchase and would recommend this case to other Canon PowerShot G7 X owners.","April 17, 2016",5.0 out of 5 stars,GSG

When it first arrived I was convinced that the camera would never fit inside it!  But its really stretchy and the camera along with a lens cap fits in perfectly, but tightly.  The belt loop and very secure and properly stitched and that combined with the tight fit means that you will not be able to get to the camera fast if its on your belt, so plan ahead.  Nonetheless, its a great sleek case, albeit with less protection.  And it squeezes down into a tiny size for storage.  The only thing I dont really like is the plastic clip, may have to break it off.,I also got the large amazon basics case for more protection, ie when tossing the camera into a backpack etc.","December 18, 2016",5.0 out of 5 stars,Pir
B00PH2SDA0,MegaGear-Neoprene-Carabiner-PowerShot-COOLPIX,"MegaGear ''Ultra Light'' Neoprene Camera Case Bag with Carabiner for Canon PowerShot G7 X, Canon PowerShot G7 X Mark II, Nikon COOLPIX AW130, S9900, Olympus STYLUS XZ-2 Digital Camera (Blue)","I really like this case. I agree with other reviewers who express concern about its ability to protect camera from a 3 foot drop. But if you want a case that will allow you to shove the G7x inside a bag or pock worry-free, it is perfect. All other cases were too bulky. It's also very compressible and so it's easy to quickly stow, leaving your hands free to shoot. I also like that I can keep the camera strap around my wrist while still having the case on the camera. That way you have the camera at the ready rather than trying to fish it out of a bag or disentangle it from a pocket. Can't comment on strength of belt loop as I don't carry it that way. My only real complaint is that it is VERY easy to deploy the lens accidentally while trying to squeeze the camera in. Unintentionally pushing  the side-mounted wifi button powers the camera ""on"" with the lens closed.  But once powered-up any shutter pressure (inevitable with this snug fitting case) will cause the lens to deploy.  Careful attention to where you press the camera will help, but I still have this problem. I'm thinking of trying the horizontal orientation instead.","December 28, 2016",4.0 out of 5 stars,Kindle Customer

Arrived quickly and fit the camera great! It was slightly snug but once I get used to using it, it was a snap to pull my camera out of it with ease. I loved having the ability to attach it to my belt. It’s more or less why I ordered it. I carry my camera on me a lot...like a lot a lot.,I used it for approximately one week which included some light hiking and a flight across the United States. Still completely pleased with it. However, once I arrived in one of my destinations I took the camera and case off my belt one evening and found that the stitching that held the belt loop nylon on was beginning to tear. :( I didn’t feel confident in it after (didn’t want my camera to come flying off my belt once the stitching completely failed) seeing that and was forced to spend more money on a generic commercial case somewhere which was big, bulky and in my opinion not as cool as this one.,Summary:,It was relatively cheap and a good deal at first. Being small, compact and flexible it was the perfect case for what I needed it for. I REALLY REALLY wanted to like this case and use it A LOT but unfortunately the stitching just kind of looked like a weak point in the product. Not really an issue of quality but more of design. If they somehow remedied this issue I would most definetly get another one which I would attach to my belt indefinetly.,4 out of 5 stars because I just liked it so much.

You can wrestle the G7X into the case, but it's tight, especially in the area of the lens/housing.  The Neoprene material and its stitching look fine, but I'm not sure it's worthy of protecting $700 camera from a drop onto a hard surface.  The limited stitching that secures the upper part of the belt loop may also be a weak point, unless your camera is very light in weight.  Removing and inserting a G7X isn't going to be a simple 'quick-draw' either, as the lens housing restricts the camera from being easily removed), so you're likely to miss a few photos.  All-in-all, the case is probably fine for protecting a lighter point-and-shoot from nicks and bruises while traveling around, but if you've got a better or more substantial camera you want to protect, I'd look for something else.  Not a big deal to me, but I did not get any lens cloth, as shown in the photo...","August 3, 2016",2.0 out of 5 stars,D. A. Waterbury

Can't read any of the type on it and there's a picture of a turtle under water to try to read through as well. One would think that a camera so many people rave about would have a manual in the box. A piece of cardboard in the box says to load the app on your iPhone. I did that but it can't connect to the camera because I can't read any of the screens. I checked for any protective tape or coverings on the screen and there's nothing. It's glossy glass.

I had to make longitudinal cuts through the case as a makeshift belt loop. Otherwise it is a reasonable light weight case for the Canon G7x Mark II.

At least, not without a lot of pushing and undue stress on your lens.,HOWEVER, if you do as others have suggested, and cut out a semicircle for the inner front of the case to fit the lens.  Then it fits PERFECTLY.,I added some pics here to show a) the (poor) fit as it comes from the factory; and b) to show my steps to cut out the face and the results of the mod.,I found a pill container cap that just matched the diameter of the lens and used that - aligned with the lens & camera pushed down into the case - to mark the cutting line on masking tape.  Then I used a VERY sharp knife to cut through.  There are two layers of very dense cardboard in the walls that are very difficult to cut, so take it carefully (you DON'T want to slip!).  After cutting I wiped glue around the cut between the pleather and the cardboard to keep the cut edges together.  Then I used a brown sharpie to color the cut edges.  Voila!,You can see in the final pics, how far the lens protrudes from the case front with the mod.  Makes it obvious how tight it was before.","February 1, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,meq123
B07KSXT9NH,GordVE-Digital-Backpacking-Cameras-Photography,"GordVE 2.7 Inch Digital Camera, HD Camera for Backpacking, Mini Digital Camera Pocket Cameras Digital with Zoom, Compact Cameras for Photography","I wanted a small, easy to use camera that could zoom for a trip to Scotland and Ireland.  The camera worked extremely well, though I never went past the 8x optical zoom.  I especially love the option to delay the shutter by 2 seconds in low light to prevent camera shake when pressing the shutter button.  Underexposing on stained glass windows (which otherwise looked all white) worked very well.I bought a spare battery and recharger.  I took 1,050 pictures over 22 days, and only replaced the battery twice.  The spent battery recharged in 2 hours.The only problem with the camera is the small cord, which I could not put around my neck.  Consequently, I dropped the camera on stone steps, and it got banged up.  It continued to produce great photos.  I took it to a camera shop, which gave me a long cord to attach to the camera's small cord, so I didn't drop it again.  However, the shop advised me that the tiny connections inside could have come loose, and the camera might not work after a few weeks.  It got me through the trip, and I will now buy another one to replace it.","February 27, 2019",5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazoncustomer

B07KSXT9NH,GordVE-Digital-Backpacking-Cameras-Photography,"GordVE 2.7 Inch Digital Camera, HD Camera for Backpacking, Mini Digital Camera Pocket Cameras Digital with Zoom, Compact Cameras for Photography","This point and shoot has been great to use and I have been quite satisfied with it considering its low price. I have attached test photos and videos so you can be the judge on the quality. I noticed that this camera is especially good at picking up accurate and bold colors in both the photo and video modes.it includes a "";Getting Started""; guide, a warranty card, a small lanyard, a 680mah battery, an external battery charger (which is nice if you plan on buying additional batteries), and the camera itself.With the popularity of smartphones, what is the appeal of this entry-level point and shoot camera? Well, unlike most smartphones, this camera features an 8x optical zoom. This is a great feature that allows you to zoom in decently close while experiencing a minimal degradation in quality. The camera's maximum video quality is 720p but it features quick auto focusing and as mentioned before, good accurate colors. The only issue that I had with the video quality is that the stabilization is not the best.Conclusion: This is overall a great entry-level point and shoot and I do not think you will be disappointed for the price. The 8x optical zoom is definitely my favorite feature and the photo and video quality is about what you would expect for a camera in this price range. There is no included SD card so you will need to buy one, and there is no included transfer cable (mini USB) so you will also need to buy one of those to load the photos and video onto your computer unless you have an SD card slot. The user interface on the camera is easy and simple to use. This camera is great for those who are not extremely technologically savvy as there is basically no learning curve. Nice job it.Disclaimer: I purchased this product with my own money for my own personal use.","February 27, 2019",5.0 out of 5 stars,Roberta Steiner

The Camera is quite small at 3 ½” wide and 2” tall and about ¾” deep.  It does have many features when taking pictures.  I typically use it to take pictures of smaller items a light box.  It does take very nice pictures and I have figured out how to make it work for my needs.  Settings are easy to change although they are small and hard to read and I must use reading glasses to see them.  Buttons are quite small as well.  For my purposes, the megapixels per picture are reduced, the flash is turned off, and I set a timer to a 2 second delay.  The camera does take pictures very quickly.  It does have a Macro feature that works well, however, make sure you are very close to the item before taking the picture.  I find that it is sometimes easier and quicker to get a clear picture of a mark using normal settings and then use picture editing software to crop and enlarge it.,Transferring pictures to your computer is simple and there are several ways to do so.  I use a cord connected to my computer directly to the connector on the side of the camera.  One neat item in the bundle is a USB type reader that has 4 slots (2 on the side and 2 on the end) that can be used to import pics from the memory card or other means.,The battery holds a charge well and is very easy to change.  Setting up the camera and getting started is very easy.  I had the camera up and running in about 10 minutes.,The bundle comes with many items.  The small tripod is handy.  The case is very small and just large enough to hold the camera.  The charger and accessories will not fit in the case.  Frankly, I only use the Camera, Charger, Memory Card, and Battery.  I keep the tripod and USB Reader available and do not use any of the other items.,Overall, the Camera is easy to use and takes very nice pictures both close up and normal.  It is a very good camera for the price.","November 10, 2018",4.0 out of 5 stars,G. Swanson

B019UDHT6U,Canon-PowerShot-Digital-Camera-Stabilization,Canon PowerShot ELPH 180 Digital Camera w/Image Stabilization and Smart AUTO Mode (Red)," I do professional photography for a living but wanted a small pocket camera for hiking/traveling/walking and quick things around the house without dragging out a bunch of equipment. It fits in a pocket perfectly! I don't know about you but if I take my pro gear out on a walking, I never actually get any exercise, I just stand around taking photos in one or two spots the whole time. Lol. So — my view on this is it's not as good as previous point-n-shoots I've had. They used to be heavier, more sturdy, better made and less expensive. This one is lighter, tad flimsy, pricier than I'm used to (for the low quality) and not as good made. Comes with a rechargeable battery which is nice but I don't love it enough to buy a backup, although it does last a very long time, charged it for the first time after 2 months of use which is about 10mins every 3 days or so. Quality is so-so and many of the basic features and settings I'm used to on most other point-n-shoots are not on this camera or very limited. An amateur can take good shots with it but only if you have the patience on the focusing. It can take a long time for it to focus on what you are trying for. For example, say you are trying to get a butterfly on a flower, it may continuously want to focus on the ground rather than the flower/butterfly area (see photo of what I mean or looks like Amazon isn't allowing all my photos so not sure if you can see it). It does AMAZING macro shots most of the time though, it automatically focuses them (best without flash on) but other shots farther away or if trying to do something quick not as great, so give it time to focus. Not the worse quality shots ever but not best either. A tiny bit muddy/painted look if you zoom into the images at 100% (see photo of 100%). The video (one attached) is decent, actually does better than photo stills. It also does not turn off ALL sounds. The settings allow you to turn off many sounds but it keeps the shutter sound, beeps when focusing and there is no way to turn it off. Personally, I don't like the sounds. If I had to choose a pocket camera for hiking and traveling again, I would save a little more and not get this one. If I only wanted to take quick macros inside for products etc, this is the camera to have. I've attached 19 photos and 1 video straight from this camera without Ps edits. ~Happy Shooting~","June 12, 2017",3.0 out of 5 stars,C. H. Greene

B019UDHT6U,Canon-PowerShot-Digital-Camera-Stabilization,Canon PowerShot ELPH 180 Digital Camera w/Image Stabilization and Smart AUTO Mode (Red)," Okay. I gave it 5 stars because I love the camera itself and don't feel I should downgrade my review because of what the listing says. Also it wouldn't let me put in four and a half. But any buyer should know that the listing says that it comes with ""64"" of something regarding memory. It doesn't say 64 of what. Could be Kbites, could be Mbites, could be Gbites, could be raw fish or tooth faerie droppings. Who knows? Turns out there is ZERO. ZIP. NADA. So if you order one of these be sure to buy some memory because it is not included and the camera would be useless without it. Good thing I'm a bit of a memory hog and bought an ""extra"" or I wouldn't have been able to use it at all until I ordered some.,Another small thing that it won't do (and I hold Canon blameless for this) is that there is no way that I can find to put a live view from the camera onto my computer screen—as you would do with a web cam. I didn't buy it specifically to do this kind of thing so I'm not let down but I do a bit of astrophotography and that kind of thing is nice. The screen is too small to tell if there is dirt on one of your lenses in the dark. It ruins the shot if you don't notice it and when you are trying to shoot a picture of the full moon and don't catch it you have to wait at least a month to set the shot up again.,With those two things in mind it's a pretty good camera and I'm happy I got it. The screen is easy to read. It's got a lot of the features that you would expect to find on a more professional grade camera. The menus are fairly intuitive once you've spent fifteen minutes or so with the manual. I should be noted that you do have to download the manual itself because it only comes with a quick start guide. In Auto mode while shooting some pictures, like the moon for example, the exposure is a bit too high but I suspect there is a setting that would fix that, which I haven't found yet. In Program mode it's easy enough to correct that kind of problem, as it is pretty easy to take control of most of the other settings.,I shot the attached video of the moon through my telescope because a picture is worth a thousand more words.,I'm still experimenting with it because I just got it yesterday but I'll update this if I think of anything else.","August 6, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,Brett Ashton
B019UDHT6U,Canon-PowerShot-Digital-Camera-Stabilization,Canon PowerShot ELPH 180 Digital Camera w/Image Stabilization and Smart AUTO Mode (Red),"This point and shoot has been great to use and I have been quite satisfied with it considering its low price. I have attached test photos and videos so you can be the judge on the quality. I noticed that this camera is especially good at picking up accurate and bold colors in both the photo and video modes.,Canon includes a ""Getting Started"" guide, a warranty card, a small lanyard, a 680mah battery, an external battery charger (which is nice if you plan on buying additional batteries), and the camera itself.,With the popularity of smartphones, what is the appeal of this entry-level point and shoot camera? Well, unlike most smartphones, this camera features an 8x optical zoom. This is a great feature that allows you to zoom in decently close while experiencing a minimal degradation in quality. The camera's maximum video quality is 720p but it features quick auto focusing and as mentioned before, good accurate colors. The only issue that I had with the video quality is that the stabilization is not the best.,Conclusion: This is overall a great entry-level point and shoot and I do not think you will be disappointed for the price. The 8x optical zoom is definitely my favorite feature and the photo and video quality is about what you would expect for a camera in this price range. There is no included SD card so you will need to buy one, and there is no included transfer cable (mini USB) so you will also need to buy one of those to load the photos and video onto your computer unless you have an SD card slot. The user interface on the camera is easy and simple to use. This camera is great for those who are not extremely technologically savvy as there is basically no learning curve. Nice job Canon.,Disclaimer: I purchased this product with my own money for my own personal use.","February 24, 2016",5.0 out of 5 stars,Kevin Breeze

B019UDHT6U,Canon-PowerShot-Digital-Camera-Stabilization,Canon PowerShot ELPH 180 Digital Camera w/Image Stabilization and Smart AUTO Mode (Red),"I wanted a small, easy to use camera that could zoom for a trip to Scotland and Ireland.  The camera worked extremely well, though I never went past the 8x optical zoom.  I especially love the option to delay the shutter by 2 seconds in low light to prevent camera shake when pressing the shutter button.  Underexposing on stained glass windows (which otherwise looked all white) worked very well.,I bought a spare battery and recharger.  I took 1,050 pictures over 22 days, and only replaced the battery twice.  The spent battery recharged in 2 hours.,The only problem with the camera is the small cord, which I could not put around my neck.  Consequently, I dropped the camera on stone steps, and it got banged up.  It continued to produce great photos.  I took it to a camera shop, which gave me a long cord to attach to the camera's small cord, so I didn't drop it again.  However, the shop advised me that the tiny connections inside could have come loose, and the camera might not work after a few weeks.  It got me through the trip, and I will now buy another one to replace it.","September 28, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,Sacramento reader
B019UDHT6U,Canon-PowerShot-Digital-Camera-Stabilization,Canon PowerShot ELPH 180 Digital Camera w/Image Stabilization and Smart AUTO Mode (Red),"We take a lot of vacations and many photos for family albums.  Our two previous purchases were of Nikon Coolpix.  These inexpensive cameras tend to last just 2-3 years (which is fine, given how affordable they are).  When our Nikon died on us, we decided this time to upgrade and purchase the Canon because Canon has a good reputation.  But we are severely disappointed.  For one, the only flash control this camera has is automatic.  This means that if the camera detects light it will not use the flash, and you have no way of manually using the flash to override the automatic sensor.  Let us say you are taking a photo of someone and there is light in the background.  The camera will detect the light and not use the flash.  But you would want to manually have the flash go off so as to light up the face of the person.  The Nikon Cookpics were MUCH less expensive than this Canon yet did have the manual flash control.  Second, the picture quality is poor - surprising, it is of less quality than the cheaper Nikon.  And finally, we realize that these are cheap cameras but nonetheless, this Canon feels flimsy and ""plasticky"" compared to the Nikon.  You may as well buy the Nikon - you will be spending less money and have more quality.","September 17, 2018",1.0 out of 5 stars,William

Stabilization, Touch Enabled 3-Inch LCD, Wi-Fi, DC-FZ80K (Black)","I was really skeptical of getting this camera for my sister. She had a cheap Nikon Coolpix point and shoot and she took some fantastic pictures with it that really impressed me, especially when using the zoom. It broke the other day after like three or four years and I figured it was time for her to upgrade. Since she did not want a DSLR because she wanted to keep it simple, I researched many bridge cameras, but their picture quality left a lot to be desired. She loved the zoom on the Nikon Coolpix P900 but I detested the image quality of that camera, especially for $500. Not this one. While OBVIOUSLY not having the image quality of a DSLR, it is fantastic for coming from such a small sensor. Not only that, but the colors of this sensor are faithful and have a lot of pop, which remind me of my Canon EOS-7D.,Honestly, my Panasonic Lumix DMC-GH3 does not have these lovely colors at default settings. What else to say about the FZ70? Its sensor has surprisingly good dynamic range. Oh, the shutter release lag is minimal. There is none of that cheapy point and shoot lag. No waiting for a photo to be captured. After locking the focus by half-pressing the button, the picture is taken as soon as you press it fully. As soon as I took the first picture, I smiled so wide, because I was not expecting such DSLR-like behavior. Click. Sharp picture. Click. Another sharp picture. And that was in low light. SO SATISFYING., I'm telling you, it's a FUN camera and I NEVER felt the desire or even thought, ""I wish I had my DSLR with me."" I would be content having just this camera for a day without anything else. The zoom is not super fast in terms of speed, but come on...for less than $300, that would be too much to ask. The lens is SUPER WIDE, and it is respectably sharp even when zoomed fully, and I did not see chromatic aberrations when shooting a sunset. Ah, funny thing: even in VGA mode, the video quality is impressive. The camera has like 200 MB internal memory, so it can only record VGA. But it looks so good in camera, my sister and me started laughing. This is coming from me, a guy used to fast DSLRs and who would not be caught dead with a point and shoot. But not anymore, because this FZ70 is AWESOME. It even records RAW files if you happen to be allergic to JPEGs. How cool is that? Enclosed are snapshots testing the colors...and handheld moonshots...one at max zoom and one at less zoom. All are on Sunset scene setting. Thanks for reading.

Stabilization, Touch Enabled 3-Inch LCD, Wi-Fi, DC-FZ80K (Black)","Pros:,The zoom is truly awesome in this.  No SLR lens can compare.  It's great for birdwatching, zooming in on a face in the crowd, wildlife shots, and even just cool stuff that's a long way away.,4k video is great.  I'm a Canon SLR person and they don't have 4k in the low or mid-range for an SLR, so that's why I got this and it is great.,Fast FPS.  The camera can take 4k video, which is 8mp at 30fps.  It claims it will do it in 4k Burst mode, which really means it takes a 4k video and will show you frame by frame and let you select ones to make photos.  Horrible to do on the camera's screen, I wound up getting software that would do it on my PC and just pulling all the images out.  Which you can do from any video, so this is an ineffective feature (at least for me).  I wanted something that would create 30 images/second, which I could go through on a real screen and post quickly.  As this feature is why I chose the Lumix over a Nikon, I'm a little annoyed at their implementation.,Cons:,Low light conditions for moving subjects are awful.  To the point that you will have low light issues in places you didn't realize were low light, and there is no ""action"" choice on the selector.  The F2.8 for the lens in wide isn't matched by a very sensitive sensor, or it's not automatically upping the sensitivity as needed.  I have a ton of blurry shots of my kids because of this.  I've played with the light levels and it is cludgey at best, completely ineffective at worst.  I've hit a sweet spot a couple of times by setting it to 1/60th of a second, but it still has issues (and my kids aren't that fast).  This is an AMAZING outdoor daytime camera, but for kids in a bounce house it doesn't work for me.,No Focus Ring, so obstructed zoom is hit or miss.  Generally, zoom and autofocus are fantastic and FAST.  This means that taking a picture of wildlife that is partially obstructed by a branch means that you may get a fantastic shot of a leaf instead of the Pileated Woodpecker you were trying for.  Also, since the aperture only goes to F-8, there's a limit to how much depth you can get so that crystal clear leaf may only be 6 inches closer than the woodpecker, but, oh well.,Very limited options on the selection wheel. They've got the fab 5 (auto, P, A, S, M), then Expressive (for filters), Portrait, Panoramic, C? (maybe custom, but defaults to 1080p/60fps), and then Video (for adjusting settings in video mode),My last complaint is the smallest, the features (like C above) are poorly explained on screen (aperture is only ""A"", which isn't useful to noobs), which means that Panasonic style features are not understandable to people with more experience.  I accidentally turned on the feature of take 3 shots and merge them which doesn't work for kids moving (but would be great for landscape shots).  Missed 1/2 of my kids' Karate class trying to fix it instead of taking pictures.,Overall, this is an AWESOME camera if you are taking zoomed pictures or videos in sunlight, or of non-moving subjects.  The autofocusing on a leaf can be annoying, but survivable.  The wifi, etc. is nice but not particularly useful for me.  I have tested it and it'd be great to put on a monopod and use your phone to selection shots in a crowd.  And for $300, no SLR can compare on value.  However, once Canon comes out with the T8i, if the 4k is good, I'll likely put this on craigslist.  Because of the crappy low light, I still use my Canon T4i if I'm going somewhere like the Baltimore Aquarium or Natural History Museum with my boys, and this camera should have put my T4i to bed.","June 29, 2018",4.0 out of 5 stars,John Roberts

Stabilization, Touch Enabled 3-Inch LCD, Wi-Fi, DC-FZ80K (Black)","I've only had the camera for three days. I have to admit that the selection and menu choices were overwhelming at first, even with some familiarity with cameras. Panasonic has some features unique to its brand and learning the terminology took some time. Rather than read the online manuals, I watched some of the tutorials available on You-Tube. I found 16 dedicated videos by Graham Houghton on the use of the camera. I'm about a quarter of the way through. The claims that the camera doesn't perform in various conditions just don't seem to hold any weight when one learns how to operate the camera properly, especially the claim that it performs poorly in low light. I took the camera to the hockey rink and shot in the lighting available in sports mode and was able to capture some great shots. I played around operating the camera in different modes outdoors and shot a hummingbird in flight at 1/8000 of a second, freezing the bird's wings in flight. Admittedly, the lighting was not in my favor from my vantage point but it was just a camera test, not an attempt at a prize winning photo. I took numerous photos of the same dahlias in different modes and ended up with a series of totally different interpretations of the same image.,I also operated the camera at low light, using the setting recommended in the videos. The results were outstanding. I've yet to explore many of the camera's other features such as post focusing and operating the camera remotely with my android cell phone.,I shot over 330 images at the hockey game and still had half battery life left according to the display. I have not tried the camera in movie mode since I seldom shoot video. From what I've experienced so far, I believe my photos will well exceed my current exposures. I've barely learned the basics of the camera's capabilities.,With the huge amount of creative control, this is not a camera you can set down and then pick up a month later and remember how to operate all of its features. And even then, a quick review of the camera's manuals or the videos may be necessary if all of the camera's potential is to be used.,While some camera fanatics may complain about the camera's sensor size or some indistinguishable lens aberration due to the camera's long lens, let's face it, most of us will never have our photos printed as wallpaper murals. We view our creations on our cell phones, tablets, laptops, and TVs. The images created by this camera can be as stunning as any full SLR with thousand dollar lenses and are limited only by the shooters capabilities, not by the camera's limitations.,A nice feature that many bridge cameras do not have is a threaded front on the lend for filters. The shooter can add a polarizing filter or ND filters to extend shutter times to take specialty photos.,If I had one negative thing to say, I would have appreciated a tilt screen since, when traveling and standing in crowds, it is sometimes helpful to hold the camera over everyone's heads and shoot down at a high angle, using the tilt screen to focus. I can live without that one feature given all of the other features of this incredible camera.","November 1, 2018",5.0 out of 5 stars,JerryInLodi

Stabilization, Touch Enabled 3-Inch LCD, Wi-Fi, DC-FZ80K (Black)"," I've had this camera for a little more than a year and use it constantly with very good results for Facebook images. I typically use the autofocus to make the shots and reduce the default circa 5K JPEG images to about a third of the original size for posting.  I've had worse luck posting video, mostly because of a very slow Internet connection that makes uploading video of any size too time-consuming to be worth the effort. From time to time I use the very fiddly so-called manual focus with a tripod for pictures of flowers, etc., with varying results.,You get unbelievable value for the price, but still you are getting what you pay for--20-1200 mm zoom, RAW images (requiring a ton  of post-processing and correction for vignetting, etc.), sort of HQ video (very useful for documentary purposes, but not for filmmaking),  surprisingly good macro capabilities (focus at 1 cm), and decent color rendition.  I like my colors a bit oversaturated, and use the Happy setting for most shots (sorry professionals).  De gustibus etc.,The 1200 mm equivalent zoom is not terribly useful unless you have a reason to photograph large objects covertly from a distance in broad daylight. It hasn't helped me at all with birds on the Potomac and I reckon that for most subjects you wouldn't want to use more than half of that zoom in good, bright daylight. Still the lens is very flexible and gives you a terrific choice of FOV for everyday subjects.,The aperture is only five point something at full zoom--not the greatest--and the tiny sensor yields a softer focus across the board that you might expect--softer and noisier, IMHO, than some cellphone and pocket cameras of comparable size. Low-light performance is pretty bad, but the camera is far from useless in low light.,On the other hand, the 20mm wide angle is very useful both for interior shots and for photographing buildings. Add this to the surprising  macro capability and you get two very strong points in favor of this outfit.,There is a new and upgraded version of this camera, the DC-FZ80, which adds 4k video of TBD quality, focus stacking, two more megapixels on the sensor, (I think) an external microphone, and a few other substantial improvements.  Same old lens. Apparently no longer has in-camera memory (??). The early reviews suggest that the image quality is still a bit sub-par from a pro point of view, but the circa $400 purchase price definitely makes the new model a bargain, though not nearly as much of a bargain as this model.,There are a number of in-camera special effects filters, some of which are fun--though the effects are easily equaled or surpassed in Photoshop or The Gimp.,I probably won't upgrade, but would definitely consider the FZ80 as opposed to the FZ70  if I were moving today from a pocket-model point-and-shoot or a lens-limited cell phone.  The additional functionality might not justify the upgrade, but would definitely enhance a first-time purchase.,This old model is still a hands-down, amazing bargain as long as you know what you are getting.  If you are on a budget and are looking for a good learner-type advanced camera, you might well consider snapping up the FZ70 while it is still available.  I've had more fun with mine than a barrel of monkeys and it shows no signs of wearing out.,NB--the attached snapshots have all been slightly post-processed in an antique version of PhotoShop and reduced in size for Web publishing.

I have bags full of camera equipment including a Mamiya RB-67, Pentax 6x7, Canon 5D Mk2, Canon T2i and a lot of glass so trust me when I say, this camera lives up to the pre-release hype.  I originally had my sights set on the Canon SX50 which is a good camera, but falls short of its Lumix peer.  My focus was to get an easy to use point-and-shoot camera for my wife since the SLRs were just too much for her to handle - but now she's going to have to fight me for it.  I will update this review as I gain more experience with the video and special functions (which there are many) in the future.  Until then, I recommend you get one while the price remains well below $400 because I don't think it will stay their long when the word gets out how great this camera performs.,UPDATE: After using this camera for nearly 6-months, I am still VERY happy with it and the pictures it produces - and would be glad to share some of the shots.  I find the extremes between other reviewers ratings interesting since I have not experienced many of the negatives mentioned and have experienced most of the positive remarks.  This camera simply works for me.  I've shot everything from sports car road races to retirements to scenery with great success and carrying this 1 lb 7.2 oz camera sure beats the heck out of hauling my 12 lbs of 5D Mk 2, with dual battery pack and 50-500mm Sigma lens around all day plus a couple extra lenses and batteries in a camera bag.  I also have no trouble taking my shots to 13x19 inch prints from either RAW or JPEG format files.  I've also read this camera is big and bulky.  Well, if you wear XXL gloves like I do, it fits just right in my hands.  It also works much better in my wife's hands than the DSLRs we have (T2i in addition to the 5D)so she is happy too! The weight is simply not a concern to us as we've both carried it around all day without any problems or side effects.  In fact, now that the price has dropped to $249 I'm going to buy another one to keep peace in the family.,Several reviewers mentioned soft pictures at the 1000 to 1200mm end of the zoom range.  I'd bet your paycheck that most of the problem is camera movement since it is very difficult to hand hold any camera still enough at this extreme magnification to get a super sharp picture - regardless of image stabilization system employed.  I've had much better luck using a monopod or even better, a solid tripod (as one reviewer suggested) to get those very sharp long range shots.,I also discovered the automatic backlit scene sensing and exposure system when I moved to the fully automatic setting - very effective!,But as I said, the proof is in the final product so if you would like to see a sample of images - reply to this review and include your email address and I'll share a few with you.","September 5, 2013",5.0 out of 5 stars,JJ

(bought refurbished from Goodios here on Amazon).,The main reason I needed a new camera was for the optical zoom. We have a lot of ""flora and fauna"" in our yard and I like to take pictures of the various critters and plant life to share with family & friends. Obviously, I can get up close to plants and flowers, but the critters are another story.,The maximum optical zoom I have on any of my older digital & 35mm cameras was 3X - 10X, which just wasn't enough to get good quality images from the distance I needed, like 100 feet.,I took a chance on the refurbished model from Goodios on Amazon because it fit my budget much better.  Aside from a 90-day warranty, the only thing different from new and refurbished seems to be the box; the refurbished is shipped in a plain brown box, but everything is there that would ship with the new camera (CD, manual, lens cap, USB cable, shoulder strap, battery, and charger).,I'm still playing with all the MANY settings (automatic and manual) but so far, this is an awesome camera for the money.,It doesn't have Wi-Fi connectivity, like some of the more expensive cameras, which I was aware of and really don't need. So if that's something you want, take that into consideration.,It does have Panasonic PhotoFun software that opens up when the camera is connected via the supplied USB cable.,You do want to get an SD card (Micro SD w/ adapter). I picked up a 64GB SanDisk on Amazon for peanuts (compared to what they used to cost not so long ago). ,]  and it's working great!,If I'm out and about and absolutely ""need"" to send one or more of the photos on the SD card in the camera, I can remove the Micro SD and pop it into my Samsung Galaxy S5 phone to email or message (or any phone that accepts SD & Micro SD).,I've attached two photos that I actually did take early this morning.

Stabilization, Touch Enabled 3-Inch LCD, Wi-Fi, DC-FZ80K (Black)","The zoom range on this camera is unbelievable.  The base camera has a 60X zoom range making it the longest of any camera available at the moment. The total zoom range in mm is 20 - 1200 mm which is very impressive. Standard SLR lenses with those types of ranges would require several lenses and untold thousands of dollars......plus the cost of the camera itself. Yet this Lumix jewel accomplishes all that and more at a scant fraction of the cost. The camera is easy to operate, has an incredible amount of built in features and much more just waiting to be discovered by experimenting.  An added bonus is the ability to extend the zoom range by selecting image resolutions less than the full 16.1M.  While there are those who will always want to shoot at 16.1M for me it is overkill.  Image resolution is a subjective issue. It is simply a matter of what you want to believe and are willing to settle for. I currently use a Sony DSLR compact camera like this Lumix, a Nikon D50 with several lenses but usually coupled with a Tamron 18 - 200. This D50 is a 6.1M camera and I have shot and enlarged flawless prints at 11 x 14 with total clarity. Some may take issue with this statement but excessive megapixels in a camera is much like owning a car that will run 150 mph when all you can go on the highway is 55 mph.  The capacity is there..........but when, if ever are you going to utilize it.  Now, if you are a professional photographer or a serious amateur and routinely enlarge to 16 x 20 or even 20 x 30 or more.....that is one thing. But if your basic need is for standard 4 x 6 prints and an occasional 5 x 7 or even an 8 x 10 then your eye will be hard pressed (if even able to) discern any difference between a 5M photo and a 16M photo.,I said all that to say this........one of the great features of this camera is the ability to increase the zoom range by selecting less than 16.1M resolution. I have taken it down all the way to 5M, still get crystal clear pictures and this increases the zoom range from 60X all the way to 270X!  Yes, you read correctly!!!  Then.....if you add the digital zoom you can end up with a total on camera zoom range of 675X.  Have you ever heard of anything like this?  Then for fun and games I took a Sony brand teleconvertor for my Sony that is rated for 1.7X and mounted it to my Lumix.  The standard filter size for the Lumix is 55mm but I had bought a Goja filter adaptor ring in order to be able to use my several hundred dollars worth of existing filters. Many of them are 58mm so I simply bought a Goja 55mm to 58mm adaptor ring and viola......instant filter availability. AND.....it just so happens that my Sony teleconvertor has 58mm threads and I was able to couple this right to my Lumix, which now takes the 675X max zoom of the camera with izoom and digital zoom, multiples it by 1.7 and now gives a total zoom range of 1147X.  That is NOT 1147 mm.............it is 1147X zoom range.,Now.......I will admit, the camera is a bear to use in a hand held mode, but that is just what I did to see worse case scenario. I am going to post a couple of pictures taken hand held at these extremes so you can just see the potential this camera offers.  My, my......we are almost talking spy type pictures from 10 miles off. I will let you judge the photos........not for clarity or subject matter.........but just for an example of the zoom range of this camera.  I will say this here........the bus in the photos was roughly 500 feet from my position and all photos were taken hand held from the same spot.,But even without the impressive zoom features......this is one heck of a camera. The pictures, even at 5M are crystal clear and will be certain to please. Then with all the built in special modes, the 11 or more internal filter modes, the 23 or so scene selection modes, and full manual mode with shutter or aperture priority mode.........you can go any route that you need for your shooting needs.,Another feature I like about this camera is that while filming a video you can press the shutter button and take a still photo. Or while viewing a video you can take still photos from the video. I am anxious to experiment with this more as I have a son in the band and I usually take multiple cameras to their concerts, etc. in order to video it and also take some still shots. With this camera I am hopeful to be able to do both with one instrument.  We have the first White Shoe rehearsal this Thursday and our first football game this Friday.  It will be a time to see what this camera can really do with its zooming ability from up in the stands.,In closing, as a camera buff of many years (40+) I am well pleased with this purchase. I have had a Pentax SPII, a Pentax ESII, a Nikon N70, a Nikon D50, several smaller point and shoot type all in one cameras and now this Panasonic. For ease of use, range of features and cost vs ability......I put this Panasonic Lumix at the top of the pack in features.  No, it does not have the quality that either the Pentax or Nikons do.....but then again..........this camera cost a fraction of what they did and some of the individual accessory lenses I have bought for them in the past cost several times the cost of this camera............so it is not even a fair comparison. But for features...........my expensive toys cannot begin to compare with the ability of this camera. I am well pleased with it.  To see the zoom range please look at some of the photos I am going to upload.","August 25, 2014",5.0 out of 5 stars,TheWaldo

The camera itself at first felt cheap and extremely lightweight, but don't be fooled; after using this camera it does a fantastic job for it's price and has an easy to use UI for adjusting settings to your likings.,While the zoom is digital (terrible), the battery charged quickly and I have yet to use the entire thing. Do be sure to use an SD card, or a micro SD card in an SD card Adapter.,Lastly, getting photos off of this camera wasn't too difficult because using the charging cord it comes with plugged into your pc will allow you to access the photos.

Although this is a very tiny camera, it met those objectives. In fact, the ease of download greatly exceeded expectations with the flash drive transfer process.

B00HNJWUBI,Sony-DSCW830-Digital-Camera-2-7-Inch,Sony DSCW830 20.1 MP Digital Camera with 2.7-Inch LCD (Silver),"When I first got this camera I was wondering if I made a mistake.  Yes I was looking for the impossible, an inexpensive digital camera with a fairly descent zoom and good features.  Can this camera take pictures in rapid succession?  No.  In continuous mode it will do 3 shots at 1 FPS.  Can you zoom in on the pictures and see good detail?  Yes and No.  Even set at 20meg the images sometimes do not bear close scrutiny if taken under low light, like indoors at night. But with enough light on the subject it takes excellent images. Did I experience a lag when taking pictures?  Well yes and no.  The camera takes a little getting used to.  While the closest focusing distance on full wide is 5 inches, once you start to use the zoom, that close focusing distance extends out to 5 feet.  So if what you want to take a picture of is within 5 feet, just keep the camera on wide and walk up to take the shot.  If you can't walk up to take the picture then use the zoom.  Until I figured this out I was very frustrated wondering why the camera would not lock focus on the subject.  So after all of these faults why have I given this camera 5 stars.  Well you get what you pay for.  I have a Sony DSLR and a Sony all in one.  Both cost about $1,000 at the time of purchase.  Those take fantastic pictures but you can't fit them in a shirt pocket.  It is unfair to compare a camera that costs a little over $100 to those.  But for what I intended, this little DSC-W830 is fantastic.  I get very descent shots which I view on my 27"" monitor.  It fits conveniently in a pocket and (once you understand the controls and get used to how it handles) takes pictures quickly and accurately enough for my needs.  If I need better I get out my more expensive cameras.  But for convenience and ease of use this little camera is a gem.","May 26, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,John

I am really not happy with how long this camera takes to process a photo.  It is incredibly slow.  I took it on vacation and someone else on the trip had the same exact camera and has the same complaint.  It takes a long time to process a photo before you can take another photo.

B00HNJWUBI,Sony-DSCW830-Digital-Camera-2-7-Inch,Sony DSCW830 20.1 MP Digital Camera with 2.7-Inch LCD (Silver),"Let me start off by saying that I have cerebral palsy which makes fine motor skill activities difficult. I am not the person that you want to call if you need a delicate touch for something because I am all ram and bam. I bring this up because this particular camera has smaller buttons to perform a lot of the cameras functions and with my rather ham fisted way of doing things I spent the first several times using the camera hitting the on/off switch rather than the button to take a picture.,I also had difficulty getting the battery and memory card into place because these actions require a very precise touch which I don’t have. I had to get help from my mom to make sure everything was in proper place. As people with disabilities have done with pretty much everything, I have adapted by changing finger positioning, so that I am not so close to two buttons. None of this is the fault of the camera of course, but thought it was worth a mention.,I will say the one camera thing that specifically bothers me is that it has a really quick trigger with my slower finger movements, I can probably end up taking 3-4 pics in a matter of seconds and that button seems pretty pressure sensitive. I can’t tell you how many interesting hockey pictures that’s lead to. It’s a solid camera, just a bit more of a challenge than I expected.","December 2, 2017",4.0 out of 5 stars,Michael Griswold
B00HNJWUBI,Sony-DSCW830-Digital-Camera-2-7-Inch,Sony DSCW830 20.1 MP Digital Camera with 2.7-Inch LCD (Silver),"I have purchased several Sony Cyber-shots over the years. I like that they take warmer quality photos, and are affordable. What I don't like so much with this model, is that the body is now plastic, where in the past it was metal. I fear dropping this one, as with an all plastic body it will be prone to cracking, etc.,There's an improvement in this model- with the fact that you can now charge your battery IN the camera. You just plug your camera into an outlet or computer to charge. In past models you always had to remove the battery and what would happen was the door latch would eventually break and you would have to tape it shut. I'm really pleased that I can now charge the battery in the camera so it will prevent wear and tear on the battery door.,The quality of photos and macros, etc is still really nice. You can set it to automatic or custom settings. I use my camera a lot on the macro setting because I am a beauty blogger and take photographs of nail polish color on my nails. Aside from the body being plastic on this model, everything else I'm happy with.","June 28, 2014",4.0 out of 5 stars,Sarah Lynn

We take pictures of inventory in our motorcycle shop. The camera was well taken care of and used about once every few months. A few weeks ago I noticed while taking still shots the image was distorted with lines going through them. I wiped the storage disk clean and reformatted it and I also reformatted the camera to factory settings. None of this helped.

It was never able to connect to my Galaxy S7 or S8 or my girlfriends IPhone.  Spent hours w chat and on the phone - they told me to do all the obvious stuff that I tried numerous times - they were stumped.  After 2 hours of getting nowhere, I had to do other things - having accomplished nothing.  They emailed me, I replied, never heard from the again.  I REPEAT:  they emailed me, asking me questions:  I answered them:  NEVER HEARD FROM THEM AGAIN.  Not only that, but in my desperate attempt to get things to work, I signed up for the premium service.  Naively, I figured since it never connected in the first place, I simply deleted it from my phone not realizing I needed to go through the Play store.  You can imagine my dismay when I saw that they had been charging me for several months for a service they were entirely unable to provide - so far they got $550 from me and provided me with nothing, other than sucking my time and energy and failing to deliver on our once-in-a-lifetime trip to Hawaii.  I will never use GoPro again - at no point did these idiots think to apologize and replace the clearly non-functioning unit, they'd rather waste hours of my life telling me to do obvious things I'd already tried doing numerous times.

B019UDHT6U,Canon-PowerShot-Digital-Camera-Stabilization,Canon PowerShot ELPH 180 Digital Camera w/Image Stabilization and Smart AUTO Mode (Red),"We recently visited Rocky Mountain National Park with the grandkids. One was trying to take photos with a V-Tech kiddie camera. One was taking photos with her hand-me-down Apple phone. The quality of the kiddie camera photos was very poor. The camera phone photos were poor quality and hard to view or download. We let them take turns using our backup ELPH and they had a wonderful time, took a few nice shots, and made great strides as photographers just with a little fooling around.,The ELPH is so intuitive, the auto setting is so nice, the anti-shake is so effective, and the view screen is so big that this turned out to be a very newbie friendly camera.,Don't underestimate the beauty of digital. You could burn off the cost of this camera in film and developing on a normal film camera in one family vacation. This baby will hold a few thousand high quality digital photos on a normal, (say 16 GB), memory card. That's a lot of pictures of the inside of a backpack, hands, feet, the rear end of the family dog, birds, ants and Mom's elbow. But among those will be a few really nice candid photos of the family at play, and I have to say we had the best time in front of the computer monitor looking at all of the easily uploaded photos.,The camera is solid and will take a fair amount of reasonable abuse. The wrist strap is flimsy, but saves the occasional accident. After a few minutes of instruction and practice the kids were naturals with the camera. Over the course of a few days the quality of the photographs, in terms of composition, choice of zoom, framing, and the like, improved dramatically.,This turned in to a great family activity, and got the kids totally invested in the vacation. It helped them to learn how to look and to see. And the operation of the camera never got in the way.,So, it's beyond dispute that, technically, this is a fine product. But moreover, in terms of value for cost as a useful thing to own, this was a worthwhile and rewarding purchase.,Please note that I bought this item for my family with my own real cash money.","June 21, 2016",5.0 out of 5 stars,Pop Bop
B019UDHT6U,Canon-PowerShot-Digital-Camera-Stabilization,Canon PowerShot ELPH 180 Digital Camera w/Image Stabilization and Smart AUTO Mode (Red),"I have returned this camera.  I bought it as a replacement for my old Powershot SD1200.  I take a lot of bird photos, and the SD1200's maximum 3x optical zoom is inadequate for this purpose.  Unfortunately, even though the Elf 180 has an 8x optical zoom, every photo I took at 8x turned out to be fuzzy.  I am positive it is the optical zoom causing the problem, because I had turned digital zoom off in the settings.  (Digital zoom photos are even fuzzier.),I subsequently bought a more expensive camera, which has not yet been delivered.  I was going to keep the Elf 180 anyway, for travel use.  But then I realized that for non-bird photos, my old SD1200 takes photos that are as good (or better) than does the Elf 180, and also has more user-friendly controls.  For example, the SD1200 has a macro button on the camera, whereas the Elf 180 forces users to drill down through a series of menus to reach that function.","May 13, 2018",2.0 out of 5 stars,Joyce

I should have known better. It DOES come with the 1 Canon kit lens. The other 2 lenses are XIT brand and the two of them together can be purchased for less than $20. They actually make the pictures worse. Also, just to note, these are not stand alone lenses. They screw onto the front of the lens like a filter would. These are completely not usable for any kind of quality pictures. An average point and shoot camera takes higher quality pictures than you will get through these lenses.,If this is your first DSLR, the kit provides a decent value. All of the components are cheap, but will give you an idea if those are things you will use and should replace with better versions.,The camera itself is (so far) awesome. The camera alone would have been a 5 star purchase. The package alone would be a 2 star purchase. The way it's listed and pictured is deceptive. Overall, it's worth the $10 over just the camera, but be sure to keep your expectations low.,All the included components are as follows:,$10.69 xit macro lens xt58wab,$8.93 xit telephoto lens xt2x58,$19.75 vivitar large gadget bag,$22.46 xit tripod xt60trb,$4.50 vivitar 4in pocket tripod,$9.16 transcend 16gb flash card,$16.99 transcend 32gb flash card,$8.68 xit remote shutter release,$4.93 xit SD/microSD card reader,$7.46 pro series digital filter set,$3.95 lens cap keeper (stick on),$2.94 xit universal screen protector,$3.99 xit digital ultraviolet filter,$3.00 vivitar cleaning kit and card wallet,$14.95 slave flash,Total accessories: $142.38,$449 Canon EOS Rebel T6 Digital SLR Camera Kit with EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS II Lens (Black)","November 18, 2017",3.0 out of 5 stars,Caete

I have been using it for about a month now, and it has been wonderful. It is a fantastic first time camera and does a great job at helping you learn it. The rating is due to what comes with the camera, so please beware.,Pros: The SD cards alone provide good value, as they can get expensive as you need bigger cards, for a first-timer, and as long as you aren't shooting raw+jpeg like I am, you won't need anything else. Also helps to mention you get a sd card wallet and a usb reader/writer. The uv and other filters are also nice if you want to use filters in your shots, when I first started out I was using a uv filter on my kit lens. I have since bought a much better lens, and do not use a filter anymore. The cleaning kit is very handy, I have no problems there but also bought a professional cleaning kit. The mini tripod is quite cute and has been handy a few times, beware, I have had trouble getting it to hold up my camera sturdy enough with anything other than the kit lens. As stated above, the camera and everything it comes with is good. It also comes with a remote shutter which is very nice as well. I tried it out with my silly little tripod and was pleased with the result.,Cons: My biggest issue with my purchase is it sounded like you are getting two extra lenses with the purchase. You're not. The picture you see of the three lenses grouped together: the bigger one is the kit lens and the two extras next to it are them. They are not lenses, they do not attach to the camera. I would call these ""lens extensions"", as they screw onto your kit lens like a uv filter does. They are also 100% worthless, please take it from someone who has already tried them, and then bought other lenses and compared the difference. I would upload the bad pictures they took, but have since deleted them out of my library. The bag it comes with is incredibly small, and barely fits all of your accessories, heaven forbid you go and get more equipment to add to it. I have since purchased a backpack that I can grow into, and the bag is now a spare parts bag. The bigger tripod is a cheap plastic, and while it is just fine for indoor photography and videos, I wouldn't dare use it on a windy day taking landscape shots. The flash could be a pro or con depending on your personal thoughts. It is not an ETTL, meaning that you have to manually adjust your settings to match the flash and how it fires, the camera will not do it for you. It also is completely stationary, it is brighter than the built-in flash, which is better for outdoor shots that you need to light up. I can imagine it would be difficult for a beginner, it was difficult for me.,Conclusion: If I had known better at the time, I would have either spent less money to get a kit without ""lenses"" or spent a little bit more to get real lenses included in the kit. The camera itself and the SD cards provide wonderful value, but I would not make this purchase again and wouldn't recommend it to anyone.","October 3, 2017",2.0 out of 5 stars,Stephen DiGiorgio

It's fully automatic but you can gradually take creative control of every aspect of your photography as you become more comfortable with the settings and features.  The tiny instruction manual included in the package gives just the basics and can be frustrating, but download the PDF file and there are your clear directions, step by step and in color.  For an experienced amateur photographer some of the items included in the kit will be redundant (who doesn't have at least two tripods?) but buying the camera, lenses, flash and cards separately would be more expensive than what you receive in this packed bundle.  The only thing I would change is one feature of its WiFi capabilities.  Unlike the Canon SX60HS, it can't wirelessly download to the hard drive of a computer.  You would use your cable or card reader.  But it's just a minor annoyance.  It can easily send your photos to any mobile device.","August 13, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,Public Name

Overall, with this price, this is definitely one of the best deals that you can get for a bridgecamera.","March 8, 2018",4.0 out of 5 stars,ZG

So many fake positive reviews about this camera here because very few of these raving reviews mention the horrible focus in their cons list.  No question the lack of focus must be at the top of any cons list.  I've missed thousands of shots because the lense wants to refocus every single shot, even after I've locked in a focal range & target to be focused on.  Like someone else here said:  This is a TOY.  Buy it if you have $300 to blow, if you have lots of spare time to waste waiting for it to refocus & refocus & refocus & refocus..., if you don't really care about getting that shot because you'll be disappointed a 1,000 times, otherwise it's not worth the frustration.  It's only a toy that zooms out far, but will fail to focus on your subject 50-80% of the time & will drive you nuts if you actually want to take a real picture & not waste your time.","March 13, 2019",1.0 out of 5 stars,Gottatrot

So I was eager to receive my recent order of a Panasonic Lumix FZ70 - but to be blown away by its performance and quality - who would have believed you could get the equivalent of a $1000 DSLR for less that [$]?My main purpose in ordering this camera was to have a digital camera that was light, easily portable and (most importantly) had a viewfinder. I have severe presbyopia and would be constantly taking off and putting on a pair of reading glasses to see the screen of my Samsung which was usually visually obscured by the ambient light of everyday outdoor shooting. This camera solves that problem as I hoped it would...but I discovered it could do so much more. I couldn't have imagined it possessed so many extraordinary features normally associated with only the most expensive DSLRs. Hand-held night photography? Check. Extreme macros? Check. In camera special effects? Check. And a zoom that has to be experienced to be believed (Check my photo in middle). Focus on a distant feature that literally can barely be seen from your current position and then slowly zoom out until you discover that it is so far away that in the full wide position of the zoom it has disappeared completely! Even has a ""hidden"" ability to make time-lapse video in the MINIATURE setting. Take pictures in reduced sizes for social media use or go full-blast RAW for Photoshop lovers. Be sure to download the full users manual PDF file for a course in this cameras many, many features.To the cameras amazing feature list  add an exceptionally protective and handy carrying case with internal straps that allow the camera lens to be cuddled by the case and leave room from the neck strap as well...and I scarcely need to mention that the kit comes with a 16GB high speed SD card. I am a confirmed addict of Amazon and this cements that relationship once again. I am SOOooo happy.","July 15, 2016",5.0 out of 5 stars,Mad Scientist

I have worked with Lumix before on a much higher end level, and their camera's are AWESOME.,When the camera is in decent to good lighting it works very well. Once the lighting starts to fade the quality almost instantly turns to pixelated garbage. During Christmas I was shooting some test footage of my family around the tree, and the results were terrible. Between the artifacts, pixelation and the camera having a hard time focusing I was very disappointed. I also was filming my black cat and the camera couldnt focus, couldnt translate the scenario. I grabbed my 80D to see if it was just a tough situation to focus on... but the 80D did just fine.,This camera should ONLY be used in controlled lighting or daytime ventures... this camera will probably be a great one for you, especially with the price. But if you are going to encounter darker rooms or places, shadows, low light environments... I would suggest getting a camera with a better lens than F2.8-5.9... and a system that can deal with low lighting better.","December 30, 2018",3.0 out of 5 stars,Jim Zuch

Stabilization, Touch Enabled 3-Inch LCD, Wi-Fi, DC-FZ80K (Black)","The LUMIX FZ80 for me is more of a video camera. While it takes very good pictures and has great capabilities in regards to manual settings, I think you'll find this to be more for video makers who also want to take the occasional high quality photo. The 4K videos are crispy clear, no upscaling or shady business there, it's a legit 4K video. The 1080p 60 FPS mode is my favorite for general filming though, combined with the powerful 60X optical zoom it really can't get much better than that. There's also the scarcely heralded slow motion video capture function which captures 720p HD video at 120 FPS, and it works really well.,Where the camera falters a little is it's features beyond those mentioned above. No external microphone input, no DC power input (only USB, you must run it off the small 895 mA battery), and no live video output (HDMI is only for playback of previously recorded videos and photos) put this camera in the ""beginner"" section for me. But this is where we are reminded of the price. You aren't going to find another camera capable of what this one is for this price. This is a bargain camera for those who wish to take a step up from pocket digicams or their cell phone cameras, and a very worthy candidate of being someone's long term main camera for Youtube or other minor video production.,All around the camera is built well and very intuitive to use once you get used to it's many built-in features. If you want to buy this and just put it on fully automatic settings you will probably not be disappointed as this camera has excellent auto adjustments both with photo taking and video. I highly recommend it all around for anyone that might be interested in this type of camera.,You can see my video shot with this camera on my Youtube page ""TheCRTProductions""","December 22, 2018",4.0 out of 5 stars,Caleb

But if you have a wi-fi capable TV, you don't need wires to see the pictures or video.,The remote app for iphone works nicely as well. And the touch screen is very useful.,One con: battery life. Just a few hours of use per charge and the camera will not function with non-OEM batteries without the smart battery id/charge control chip. So buy lots of batteries and an external charger.

My only minor complaint is that it's tricky to learn how to use only a slight pressure on the shutter button to depress it halfway in order to focus before depressing all the way to release the shutter. It's mostly a learning problem, but the key is for the user to wait for the on-screen focusing aid to change to green before depressing the shutter all the way down.","May 8, 2017",4.0 out of 5 stars,Rex Haskins

Do buy the cable; I had a very small USB cable for my old Canon camera but it would not fit the Nikon. It takes a while to get the hang of pushing the shutter release halfway, then pausing, then pressing it home. I think the people who complained of blurry pix were pressing the shutter all at once. One function I like is you can reduce a shot to an email-able size (640x480) in the camera. It makes a copy.,I selected this camera mainly because it takes AA batteries.

And, two pictures in a row, your kid will be done with that and moved on to something new by the time it is ready to take a second photo.

B01MRCWQRM,Nikon-26518-COOLPIX-A10,Nikon COOLPIX A10,Great camera. I have owned Nikon film cameras for years. There are no better cameras in the world despite what Canon owners profess !

B01MRCWQRM,Nikon-26518-COOLPIX-A10,Nikon COOLPIX A10,"These are good quality cameras that last. I usually purchase the L32 for work but it is getting hard to find it available. The Coolpix L32 (,) has a 20.1 mega pixels sensor and this one has a 16.1 mega pixels sensor and that makes a bit of a difference in picture quality but if this is something you would notice, you would not be getting a camera of this type.,There are many cameras of this type that are either inexpensive and of bad quality or great quality but very expensive. This camera falls in a vanishing category of great quality at a reasonable price. This camera will take great quality pictures at 16.1 mega pixels and it is important to note that the zoom is optical which means that you will not give up any of the resolution when you zoom in. If your goal is to get the best quality you can get, and this camera does not make you happy, I do not think that the L32 would make you much happier so you will have to move to professional cameras that have detachable lenses and you are looking at many times the price.,There is something that you will not like about this camera and the only reason I gave it 4 stars. The world is moving fast to 4K video resolution but unfortunately this camera cannot even do 1080p recording. Considering that most cell phones today have 1080p video recording capabilities, you would think that a device that all it does is camera functions, would at least have the ability to record 1080p video. If you are looking for a quality camera that is easy to use and you want it to last, this camera is highly recommended. But be sure first that you just need a camera for pictures and not for video. This may be the reason why these cameras are at the brink of extinction, they are great picture cameras but our mobile devices have spoiled us so much that we do not want just a picture camera any longer. When we consider buying a camera, we do it because we want something better than what we already have in our pocket and that usually means that we are looking for optical zoom and quality lenses with quality video capabilities.,If you are still interested in this camera, here are some things that you may want to know:,1) It has an easy to view 2.7"" screen.,2) Operation is very simple and the menus are easy to figure out without having to read a manual.,3) It uses 2 AA batteries that you can buy everywhere. I had cameras with rechargeable batteries that go dead if I do not use the camera for a few months or their charger is proprietary and when it is broken or lost, it costs a lot to replace it. I love the simplicity of just putting 2 new commonly used batteries and be good to go.,4) It takes the full size SD memory card which means that you can just put in an adapter (many micro SD cards come with a free adapter) and turn it to a micro SD card while you will not have to throw away your old full size cards.,As for durability, we use cameras for the nursing staff to take pictures of patients and enter them to our electronic health record (EHR) software. We also use them for employee badges. Although we do not need high resolution pictures for these functions, when we get the less expensive cameras, they do not last for more than a few months. I always find them dead or the battery compartment door broken and held by rubber bands. So I have been replacing those $30.00 to $50.00 cameras with the Coolpix L32 and this A10 and I do not have any problems anymore.,Note that this camera does not come with a USB cable unless you purchase the bundle and it has a non standard connector. You can either use a USB card reader like this one ,, or you can buy the USB cable here, ,, which costs about 12 bucks at the time of this review.","July 8, 2018",4.0 out of 5 stars,John V.

The picture quality is terrible, many pictures are unstable, there are less features on this model than on the one from five years ago.

When I went to amazon to look at the order to figure out what had happend (and  to see if they had credited my account for the part they were not including) they had completely removed the portion of my order that had included the cable?!! So, now I get to track down another cable.  Then I found out that all the usb cables for Nikon are proprietary. You have to use their cable. Then I noticed there is no memory card included with the camera - this is my mistake not catching this before I ordered it.

It is a good camera for around $100 even if it only lasts,about a year.

B00HNJWUBI,Sony-DSCW830-Digital-Camera-2-7-Inch,Sony DSCW830 20.1 MP Digital Camera with 2.7-Inch LCD (Silver),"Nice camera but has some serious problems. I compared the photos from this 20.1 MP camera to my Nikon S4000 12 MP camera. The DSCW830 (in landscape mode) has a problem with bright sun as it causes washout. That does not happen with my Nikon. We have gravel walkways and if the sun is shining the DSCW830 has a problem photographing the gravel, the Nikon does not. My 5 MP phone camera also does not. Other areas that are in the sun also get washed out. It appears that the brightness overloads the image sensor. I have been taking photos of our yard for years as we have lots of flowers and stuff that blooms from Spring to Fall. I compared a lot of previous photos taken with other cameras/phones and the comparison to the DSCW830 was disappointing. The color and clarity were not what I had hoped for.,However, if you are not doing outdoor photos then this might be a good camera as it is easy to use and easy to setup.","July 19, 2018",1.0 out of 5 stars,S.

B00HNJWUBI,Sony-DSCW830-Digital-Camera-2-7-Inch,Sony DSCW830 20.1 MP Digital Camera with 2.7-Inch LCD (Silver),"I honestly am considering returning this camera if I still can... I loved my Sony Cybershot cameras in the past which is why I purchased this and I assumed this one would yield *relatively decent* pictures. I wasn’t naively hoping for super crisp, professional shots considering the price, but I am very disappointed with the quality of the pictures this camera takes.... even with a flash, the pictures just aren’t any good. The speed of the shutter is super slow so if you’re trying to take even slightly low light photos without a flash, they will be, with no doubt, super blurry and grainy... and with a flash, the picture is washed out and everyone has red pupilsz The camera is lightweight, which is nice but I honestly don’t even bother bringing it with me places because the photos it takes aren’t worth the time or energy.... I was hoping for a light weight, quality point and shoot to use when I don’t want to carry around my SLR... and to replace using my iPhone all the time. No such luck with this lil guy, unfortunately... Perhaps I’ve lost my touch with using these little cameras, but I truly feel this products isn’t worth the money, especially for someone without any background in photography, which is who this ideally would be perfect for... in a perfect world.. anyway, don’t bother. And I’ll just add, writing this review makes me want to see if I can return it even more now.","October 10, 2018",3.0 out of 5 stars,Sarah Mahaney

There is a setting in the menu ""easy"" that they can leave and get automatically the best settings without them having to change much.

I even get comments like ""cool, someone with a real camera!"". This lousy replacement is so bad i ended up like everyone else using my iphone instead. Disappointed,.,Original review:,Purchased this to replace my Sony DSCWX9 which i loved until it is acting up after many years (plastic battery lock fails which i held up with a piece of tape) and it is not restarting properly upon pressing start button.,I want another Sony. I had had two previous DSC generations with Carl  ZEISS lens and i like to stick with it. After researching and reading the reviews, I thought Sony DSCW830 would be good replacement but NO.,1. Picture quality not good - the colors does not come close to the true colors that my old sony takes. The old sony takes sunsets for example, showing vibrancy in the hues,I take many photos for real estate properties and compare with my old sony, this one pales in comparison. it does not capture good ANGLES like the old one does. I took photos of the same rooms from same position, the DSCW830 cannot capture as much and as wide.,2. Smaller display LCD screen. I knew that before buying from the specs but usually when  they change a newer model, it is an upgrade. in this case, they reduce screen size for what? save cost of manufacture???,The only positive thing i like is that the video recording is quick and good. And, it is lighter and smaller so fits in my pocket without much weight. but these do not compensate for poor quality photos.,I do not recommend this camera. wish i can return it for a better one.","September 28, 2018",2.0 out of 5 stars,JinSh

So I bought this camera for a special event TOMORROW, Jan 25th, 2019. It arrives, looks OK, BUT, where is the AC ADAPTER it says and shows comes with it? Missing item? YES, but it's MORE than just that. The little square box, which has 2 inputs, 1 for the USB connection(other part of the USB, a micro USB, connects to the camera itself to CHARGE IT, WHEN the AC Wall adapter is plugged in) ...and the other ""2-port"" connection, the ""POWER CORD(Mains lead) which IS NOT Included in the US/Canada/China VERSION of this camera),  Look at the Instruction manual, 2nd page, and it shows For Customers in the USA/Canada/China, a square box, that has an AC Adapter that pulls out from the side so you can plug it in and charge it. NOPE! NOT WITH THIS CAMERA!...I was sent this yesterday, spent 30 minutes on the phone being apologized too. The Rep said he'd send out another camera, and I am too take out the AC Adapter from that camera, and return the rest...I said PLEASE MAKE SURE it has the AC ADAPTER, because if I get this again, and there's no AC adapterfor me to plug in, I'm gonna be really PO'd....After being put on hold, I'm told, YES IT DOES, and we'll overnight it for FREE!...OK, TY!!...Well it just came, and it's the same damn thing, NO AC ADAPTER to plug into the wall...Now, you CAN charge it via the USB using your PC & supplied USB Cable. Now for some, that is perfectly A-OK....But, for myself, and/or others who may not own a PC, or only have an older PC with a lot less USB Ports too access, it's not OK!...Now I won't do that ever again because in the past I did that with another small item that said I can charge it via my PC and supplied USB Cable and it F'd up my PC within a few minutes, so never again. I fought for months with those companies to get the money to fix my PC, and finally did!  So again, this HAS NO AC OUTLET w/ ""PRONGS (if you will) to plug into the wall...IF you wanna charge this via your PC, and that is OK with you, godspeed....It's Not hard listing the ACTUAL CONTENTS, how it charges etc...IF this ad said, CHARGING THE BATTERY VIA THE USB & YOUR PC ONLY, IN THE US/CANADA/CHINA...OK, not a problem then I look for a different camera....So i blame Amazon, and Sony for this BS and utter nightmare...Just look at the image in the Instruction manual! I did that before I bought it, and I also read other customers questions and replies, and YES it comes with a charger and AC ADAPTER.....While I guess, technically true, if the camera's INSTRUCTION MANUAL SHOWS THE AC ADAPTER THAT PLUGS INTO THE WALL, THERE BETTER BE A DAMN AC ADAPTER THAT PLUGS INTO THE GODDARN WALL!","January 24, 2019",2.0 out of 5 stars,Ed Herrel

B01CG62D00,Kodak-Friendly-FZ43-BK-Digital-Optical,"Kodak PIXPRO Friendly Zoom FZ43-BK 16MP Digital Camera with 4X Optical Zoom and 2.7"" LCD Screen (Black)","Full disclosure: this is a fantastic little camera and it's cheap. People setting their expectations too high are bound to be disappointed; to do so with this camera and expect it to be National Geographic quality shots are going to be disappointed. It's easy to forget that sometimes we have to start somewhere. That we weren't born natural artists or with a camera or paintbrush in hand. This is a fantastic little starter camera. Here's a couple things about cameras. Megapixels don't matter, zoom does. But when zoom doesn't pan out (rimshot), megapixels matter. So with a high megapixel camera with poor zoom comes along, megapixels matter big time. It allows you to edit and crop without sacrificing photo quality. ISO means how much light gets in the lens, illuminating your subject. Higher the ISO, the more light and less need for a flashlight, torch, lantern, match, etc. This camera takes AA batteries and a full-sized SD card. Pick up a 4-pack of rechargeables and a Class 10 SD card and you are set to go. Take lots and lots of pictures. Get used to the idea of ""no more film"". Go out there and make mistakes. Take lots of stupid pictures so when that perfect one comes along, you know what to do.","January 15, 2018",5.0 out of 5 stars,Frequency Jones

Just be sure to buy some rechargeable AA batteries to use with this camera (or find a very good deal on a bulk supply of alkaline cells). Otherwise, the optical quality of this camera is excellent for a point-and-shoot camera in its price range. Color rendition, optical (and digital) zoom, manual settings variety, and ease of use are all great. The battery issue is actually a plus for those searching for a good camera deal, as a small deficiency of that type will make the camera less popular with the typical user, and it will therefore be priced lower to sell off quickly.,You should be able to find a great discount on new or ""open box"" used cameras. Mine was purchased ""used, like new"" and it didn't have a scratch on it.,You will need to study and try out the various manual ""scene"" settings to get exactly the results you desire. If you make the proper setting selections, you'll create images of much higher quality than any phone camera.,So, three points :,1. Buy rechargeable AA batteries for this camera, or buy bulk generic alkaline packs. No Duracell etc. as they last somewhat longer, but are not justified by the much higher price.,2. Stay alert for discounted units.,3. Test out the many image options to acquaint yourself with the camera's capabilities for the best results.

I had lost my old camera (it was later found after being digested by the couch), and I needed a new one. I got the thing for one main reason: it looked almost identical to my two-year-old GE camera that was lost. After getting it, it was basically the same product. It operated identically to the GE C1440 W, and i was very happy with the little thing. It takes really good pictures, and make sure to use the mode applications. They really help out. I was in Morocco on a fast bus, but I was still able to take crystal clear pictures without streak using the ""sport"" function on the camera. While this is clearly the same camera I had before, it still did everything I wanted it to do. Sometimes, the super-zoom function isn't the best (pix get a tad blurry), but, for the money, I can cope with that. Funny how GE and Kodak are somehow connected at the hip.

For some reason this camera doesn't like it. It's 32GB, which I picked over a 64GB card specifically because some devices don't work with cards over 32. It works in my MP3 players and another camera.,The picture quality is pretty bad. My Moto E4 is 13 megapixels vs. the Kodak's 16, and yet the pictures from the Motorola (itself not even being an especially impressive camera) are about twice as clear. In pictures from the Motorola phone, I can read text on a pill bottle half the size as the smallest readable text in pictures from the Kodak. It's nice to have a real 4x optical zoom, but at the 2x zoom level the Kodak only looks on par with a cropped photo from the phone. Functionally, this camera really only has a 2x zoom benefit over a wide shot from my phone. I'd rather just take a wide shot and crop out the exact part I want later. I also have a Samsung SL30 which wasn't a whole lot more than this several years ago, and it is also better. Unfortunately, I think the Point & Shoot camera industry is mostly dead.,Focusing speed is not bad for a cheap camera, but processing and saving the image is slower than I expected.,Some people are complaining about batteries dying quickly. Possibly this camera is less efficient than it should be, but alkaline batteries are generally not great for cameras because the zoom/focus and image processing actually use a lot of power even if only for a second or two. Alkaline batteries are terrible for fast draining, even only in short bursts like that. I like AA cameras because you can always grab some AAs in an emergency, but for regular use you should use disposable lithiums or rechargeable NiMH.,Overall, there seems to be very little reason to have this camera. I wanted an acceptable quality camera to use separate from my phone, but this isn't it.","July 20, 2018",1.0 out of 5 stars,A Customer
B01CG62D00,Kodak-Friendly-FZ43-BK-Digital-Optical,"Kodak PIXPRO Friendly Zoom FZ43-BK 16MP Digital Camera with 4X Optical Zoom and 2.7"" LCD Screen (Black)","I bought this camera for a child about a year ago.  I wanted to take time to get to know it before submitting a review.  I was looking for an inexpensive camera that took decent pictures and was from a brand that is known for cameras or at least electronics.  There are few cameras that cost less than $100 from a reliable brand.  The only cameras geared toward kids are more like toys and are about 1 Mp so this was our best find.  The camera is compact, easy to use, and takes decent pictures, especially for the price.  The video is choppy and you can hear the auto focus constantly.  While i didn't buy the camera for its video capability that is one of the favorite features of the child, so it's important to know if you care about the video.,As other reviewers noted, the battery life is ridiculously short, even from taking it out of the box.  We quickly bought rechargeable batteries.  I would say that the battery life lasts 15-20 minutes, even with regular non-rechargeable batteries.  It's fine for playing around the house, but if we were out taking pictures on a vacation or a hike, it would be extremely frustrating.  Don't buy this camera if you intend to use it for any length of time to take pictures.  If you're looking for a first camera for a child (5-9) that will be okay using it for short time periods, it's okay.  I do agree with other reviews that leaving the batteries out in between uses also helps prolong the life of the batteries, which is ridiculous.  Too bad the battery life isn't better, I was hoping we'd be able to use this camera for a long time.","August 24, 2018",2.0 out of 5 stars,JG

B00I8BIBCW,Sony-DSCW800-Digital-Camera-Black,Sony DSCW800/B 20.1 MP Digital Camera (Black),"I  got tired of taking photos with my phone , i wanted a real camera , that had a real zoom . I have a number of very expensive  SLR's but they are heavy  to carry around all the time . This is the perfect mix of convenient  and efficient . To look at copies of your photos , all you have to do is simply take the card out of  the camera  and put it into your computer , and you have them ready to transfer to your hard drive . plus if you want you can use a cable  like you would do  with a phone . it is a cheap camera , but it takes expensive photos  . it doesn't do the same as my  $3000.oo  NIKON's , and the reviews here  seem to think it should . but to take  great snap shot photos it is as good as any cell phone camera , and it very small  easy to carry  thus you are going to  take more photos that you would not do other wise , even with a cell phone camera .

B00I8BIBCW,Sony-DSCW800-Digital-Camera-Black,Sony DSCW800/B 20.1 MP Digital Camera (Black),"I have had 4 or 5 Sony digital cameras over the years and they have been great.  When I broke the screen on the last model (totally my fault) I was confident that Sony was the way to go.  A quick google search listed this model as the 2018 best point and shoot under $100 and I was sold.  However, I was deeply disappointed when it arrived.  Honestly I don’t care too much whether a camera has 8MP or 20MP (I rarely enlarge photos).  What I do care about is how long it takes to take the picture.  I hate trying to get a picture and by the time the camera focuses and shoots the subjects (usually kids or animals) have already lost patience.  This camera is way too slow; after every picture there was about a 3-4 second delay when the screen went blank.  Most pictures came out blurry.  Even changing modes didn’t help.  For those who care, this camera felt flimsy, my other Sony was lightweight but had a solid metal casing.  I might have got a lemon but I am guessing Sony got lazy with so few point and shoot cameras being used these days. So I am returning this camera, I haven’t decided on a replacement yet, but this is not worth $80.","May 15, 2018",2.0 out of 5 stars,Katie

I have to hold it very steady and even then the shutter speed seems too slow as I have a lot of blurred pics. There is  one small thing that there is really no need for and that the USB cable is not standard and I had to buy a spare just to connect to a PC or charge; so you have to use their cable and not the same one you would use for your phone or Echo, Etc. If I had to do it all over I would have selected another camera, and would recommend trying to get something better because blurred photos can be very disappointing.","January 2, 2018",3.0 out of 5 stars,AKM

B00I8BIBCW,Sony-DSCW800-Digital-Camera-Black,Sony DSCW800/B 20.1 MP Digital Camera (Black),"I am an amateur photographer and own three DSLR cameras with a selection of lenses. However that collection does not eliminate the need for a handy item for just daily needs. I keep this one especially in my car's glove box as a reserve for occasions which require something better than my cell phone camera. For that purpose it meets my expectations and even exceeds it. Yet, this is still a snap shot device with a relatively low price tag and therefore  a DSLR level quality (like background blurring, high shutter speed, high level of low light performance etc.)should not be expected.,Pros:,-Lightweight slim and  stylish design: It can fit in small spaces and look and feel like a high quality item.,-USB charging ability: That is one of the selling points for me. I keep it in my car and I don't want to run out of power any time or go through the hassle of removing the battery and charging it separately ,which requires carrying the charging adapter all the time and also the ability to plug in that adapter. Instead. all I do is to connect it to my 12V car USB charger and it pretty quickly accumulates good amount of charge level... It comes with a wall adapter (5V 0.5A) which connects to a detachable USB cable (so you can use the cable and attach it to any USB charger). But be careful about the USB cable. The standard USB-micro B cable that charges most mobile devices do not work for this type. If you need a replacement or an extra you need to buy a USB-UC E6 cable.,-Easy menu mode: Practicality should be the main focus in a snapshot device and even my grandfather could get through this menu. One of the most user-friendly interfaces I have seen so far.,-Panoramic shoot ability: That was a surprise for me. I had not read the product description in detail before buying and that was such a handy function. I used to take panoramic photos by taking tens of photos with my DSLR and stiching them with a software which was both difficult and time consuming. This function does it instantly and produces comparable quality photos.,-5X optical zoom: When it comes to zooming, in photographic terms, the less is often more. The best lenses even come with no zoom at all. However for a practical item like this, zoom is essential and 5X is a good range for the optical zoom (it is also critical that you compare the optical zoom capacities of devices and not the digital zoom before making a judgement.),-Image quality: As I said above, it does not match the quality of a DSLR and I don't care about the high pixel size either. For cameras with small sensor sizes like snapshots, it is actually better to get a low MP device for sharper images, but this one not bad at all especially in daylight. HD Video quality is also good but again depends on the light...,-Price: the $78 price tag as of august 2014 makes it one of the most affordable snapshot cameras in the market. You can get better deals from time to time but this is quite appealing too.,Cons:,-Low light performance: Again, I want to stress that I am not expecting professional quality from this device, but I found the low light performance moderate at best. The noise was somewhat irritating even with flash.,-Slow shutter speed: It has a continuous shooting mode which is supposed to take multiple frames in a short time as long as the shutter button is depressed. However this device has a long long refractory period between shoots that it is not even worth bothering with that mode. You need to decrease the image quality 3 steps to be able to notice some multiple shooting effect and that is not worth it. So if you wish to take a photo of a flying bird or a running person or a passing by car, you don't have much choice to take multiple photos and decide later.,-Zoom buttons: I like the zoom to be a ring style beneath the shutter button but this is like a plus and minus at the back which is not very convenient.,-No optical viewfinder: This is not a problem for this model only. Most recent cameras sacrifice from an optical viewfinder and all you get is a digital image on the screen to help you adjust your photo before taking it. First of all it does not give the sense of taking a photo but more importantly digital screen viewfinder drains battery and also performs bad in bright light.,-Video focusing sound: While recording video of a closely located object (where there is a constant need to re-adjust autofocusing) and if the surrounding is silent, you can hear the sound of focus adjustments in your recording. But as I said that is only obvious in full silence and for short distance recordings.,Overall you like it or not depends on your expectations. For me it is a handy and adequately performing device with quite useful features. I am happy with this purchase","August 28, 2014",5.0 out of 5 stars,Muttley

I had one before the era of digital cameras and then I purchased my first digital version 12 years ago.  My 12 year old very outdated Canon Rebel was still taking good pictures but the lag time and some other issues had me looking to finally upgrade to a newer version.  After reading reviews, I decided to go with the T6 and the package deal offered here on Amazon.,This camera is everything I expected it to be.  An upgraded and better version of my older one.  All of my Canon lens and my Canon Flash attachment can be interchanged.  I still haven't had a chance to figure out how the Wi-Fi features works but will get to that feature shortly.,I am strictly a novice photographer. I really have no idea how to use any of the manual settings.  This camera helps a novice feel more like a, pro.  The quality of the pictures is impressive.  I highly recommend this camera for anyone that enjoys photography but may feel a bit intimidated by some of the more complex and expensive SLR cameras.  This camera is easy enough for anyone to figure out.,I also recommend this package.  Although I won't use everything that was included, the memory cards, the UV filters ,and the two screw on lens attachments make it worth purchasing the bundle.  As for the UV filter it's good to use just to protect your camera. Sometimes I remove it,before taking a picture and then screw it back on when I am finished. It's a great extra layer of protection.","July 25, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazon Customer

Is important to note that not all the things from the bundle are of very good quality but many are really useful. In our case, the most useful items of the bundle are: Tripod, sd cards, bag, cleaning cloth, external shooting cable. I'll upload some photos shoot with the camera with the default kit lens it came with, important to note that I shoot in RAW and use Lightroom, nothing mayor, just a bit of contrast, just a little bit of saturation and sharpness.

The tripod is a cheap-o, but does the trick for beginners.  The polarized filter is excellent.  I leave it on the camera as a lens protector.  The card case is handy for all the SD cards.,I'd recommend this camera in a heartbeat, but most of the non-canon accessories are garbage. It's a great beginner/intermediate camera.  The auto and pre-set options aren't worth using, and you'll be disappointed with the pictures those take.  I highly recommend taking the time to learn the aperture, shutter, ISO, etc.  It's easy to get off of the auto-mode and use AV, TV, P modes.

There are a lot of folks out there who do an excellent job of providing that sort of detailed information. In fact, I read a number of those reviews and found them very helpful. My decision to purchase the Lumix FZ80 was based almost entirely on the long telephoto lens. What I got in doing so was a heck of a lot more than a great zoom. I couldn't be more impressed with the picture quality even when using it in maximum telephoto. Our home has a glassed-in porch that overlooks a lake, so most of the time I have the FZ80 set up on a lightweight tripod. Virtually all my picture taking is through the porch windows, and the results are stunning. I am continuously blown away at how sharp and bright the pictures are even when shot through triple-paned windows. The FZ80 is small, but not too small, light, and very comfortable in my hands when off the tripod. I love the FZ80 and highly recommend it for those like me who are rank amateurs but love taking nature and wildlife pictures. I realize that the FZ80 can do a lot more than what I'm doing with it, but I use it basically as a point and shoot camera and boy does it point and shoot. The FZ80 is exactly what I was hoping it would be and does exactly what I was hoping it would do.","October 24, 2018",5.0 out of 5 stars,GPFord

I am literally amazed at the quality of pictures just with using the factory settings to get started.  The capabilities for going further into post image modifications of the better photos are so far advanced over what is possible with the older technologies, and that will be a continuing learning curve......but because this camera has such built-in potential in all of its features, I will probably not have to think about a replacement camera for years to come.  One thing that REALLY pleases me is that I do not have to lug around another large bag of supplementary lenses to get what this camera is capable of already.

It'll still get broken, but at least it's not your phone and you're not out a ton of money. It is in fact the cheapest camera I could find where the image quality didn't make me want to yeet it into the sunset.,Overall, it's equivalent-to-or-better-than most smartphone cameras. It's got a decent optical zoom, so you can zoom in a bit without losing picture quality so it's actually better than a phone-camera in that sense. The zoom lens neatly retracts into the body when the camera is off so you can still stuff it into a convenient pocket (which is good because this listing doesn't come with a case). The sensor isn't anything to write home about, but it's the standard 1/2.3"" size for a decent compact camera (and the same or bigger than most smartphones) and gets the job done.,This has all the basic functionality I expect out of a camera - zoom, half-press the shutter button to check focus, a few different shooting modes that I will ignore in favor of ""auto"" 95% of the time, and a menu to review your taken photos.,Digging through the settings/menus seems a bit un-intuitive to me, but again I'm going to be running on auto 95% of the time so that impacts my experience very little.,It runs off (and came with) two AA batteries.

I am taking photos of still objects, not moving objects.,Many photos (with and without macro mode on) are blurry. I have always used Fuji Finepix camera and they took much better closeup photos, but none of their current cameras use AA batteries (only proprietary ones) and were the smaller form factor like this camera. I prefer using AA batteries so I can recharge/swab new batteries on the fly when I am in a dark attic or crawl space. Having to buy multiple proprietary batteries and already have an extra charged one is a pain.

It is, it’s also very light and made of plastic on the outside. Comes with a wide lense which is cool. So far everything is decent for the price. However when I started filming and taking pictures I was incredibly disappointed. The quality is worse than my iPhone 6s, which is saying a lot because my phones quality isn’t the greatest. That alone had me send it back for a refund because I’d rather use my cameras phone than a poor quality camera. :/ sorry, if they improved the quality on this thing, it may be worth the price. Otherwise, I’d recommend looking elsewhere. Really disappointed.","June 5, 2019",1.0 out of 5 stars,Amazon Customer

I know most people use their phones to take pictures but I figured a camera would be a nice back up to have. I did some looking and I came across this vlogging camera at a decent price. I had it shipped to myself to make sure everything was good and user friendly and this is what I found. 1) you need a memory card. That’s pretty much given with any camera and luckily I had one laying around. 2) the extra battery is an awesome bonus! 3) the main thing is the user face is easy to use and takes decent pictures. I uploaded some to my computer to see the quality and they look great! Everything thing is super well packaged and the flip out screen is awesome for getting selfies.,"May 12, 2019",5.0 out of 5 stars,Marky McClain

You can also send pictures via a wifi hotspot which is useful to quickly post pics to social media via your phone.

I should have waited and saved for a better quality camera.  I use my camera to take product photos of the hand fabricated jewelry I design.  The shutter is a lengthy distance from where I hold the camera thus, I sometimes ""miss"" pushing it all the way down.  It's an awkward design for my hands.  Also, the camera shell is very plastic.  I know that this is the norm now but, my last 2 Sony Cybershot cameras didn't feel so cheap.,The resolution, on the highest setting available for this model, is sub-par.  Unlike the last two Sony Cybershot cameras I have had, this model doesn't handle low light well at all.,Having written this review, I must say that if one were going to use a camera for something like casual family captures, it's probably acceptable.  I did myself a disservice by not doing more research with this model.","January 14, 2019",3.0 out of 5 stars,D. Caldwell

I couldn't have been more WRONG.  I can't tell you the number of photos I have missed because I had the camera in my lap, picked it up to point and click, and its little brain was still trying to determine what the lighting was supposed to be.  And don't think, ""well the lighting is off on that one, I'll take another right away"". Nope, it is really a 5-sec delay between photos  I invested not only in this camera but and extra battery and battery charger.

Do a search on ""DocToPDF reviews,"" and you'll see what I mean. I can't imagine why Sony has not gone after this site to protect its customers and prevent infringement of its copyrights.,There is a workaround: Sony does permit a free download of a 2013 manual for an earlier version of the Cybershot that is close enough to the features of the current version to be usable, but Amazon won't allow me to include the link in my review.

It's only six months old, and the shutter button and the lens both wobble. (The lens wobble is noticeable when the camera is closed; it doesn't affect the quality of the photos.) It also occasionally struggles to find the right lighting when you're taking a picture soon after turning it on, providing wildly overexposed shots. And be warned that once it's claiming anything but a full battery (four bars out of four), it's going to start dropping fast.,It takes fine pictures and doesn't cost much, making it acceptable for occasional use, especially if you'd expect to need more zoom than you'd get from a cellphone camera.

The button to turn it On/Off was not very responsive and had to be pressed several times. The telescoping lens would not open fully at times requiring the camera be turned off then back on. This happened a lot. Once I turned on the flash but decided to not take the photo and I turned the camera off. Next day when I turned the camera on it would freeze and the screen would tell me to turn it off then back on. Did this several times. Tried turning off the flash and it finally worked again. Software issue? If I turned on the flash I used it and could then turn it off and on with no problem. Still under warranty but I'm going to dump it and try another brand.

B01CG62D00,Kodak-Friendly-FZ43-BK-Digital-Optical,"Kodak PIXPRO Friendly Zoom FZ43-BK 16MP Digital Camera with 4X Optical Zoom and 2.7"" LCD Screen (Black)","(See updates below this original review.),This is a great little instamatic type pocket camera as long as you use rechargeable batteries and don't mind charging them frequently. Of course it's nowhere near the quality of a DSL camera, but the price (especially when discounted) is a lot less as well. The camera didn't work in cold weather when all my other electronic devices work just fine. However, that was with the cheap batteries that came with the camera. The camera does go through good renewable batteries quite quickly, however--more quickly than my other cameras do.,Update after I've used the camera a while: I was having to recharge the almost-new, name brand rechargeable AA batteries in a high quality charger (i.e., I knew the batteries and charger were both good) after taking only around a dozen shots. So I called Kodak's support and was told rechargeable need to be at least 2300 mAh (milli-amps). So if you use rechargeables and find they drain too quickly with this camera, check the mAh reading. The support woman suggested trying new Energizer or Duracell non-rechargeable (i.e., throw-away) batteries to confirm the camera is fine and the low-mAh batteries are the issue. I asked why this is not mentioned in the documentation that comes with the camera and she said it's because they don't mention using rechargeable batteries.,Update 5/2019: I've had battery problems with the camera since it was new, buying and trying 2800 mAh batteries along with many others. It became clear the camera had electronic issues. I'd get battery exhausted warnings even with new batteries but by opening and shutting the battery compartment, the camera would work just fine. And occasionally I'd get a message to reformat the memory card though that also was fine and the error disappeared when I opened and shut the compartment. Kodak quickly agreed to replace it under warranty, however, they refuse to pay the return shipping (roughly $8, cheapest rate) which I feel they should pay.,My recommendation is if you buy this camera, test it out thoroughly when new, using either throwaway batteries or 2300 mAh or larger rechargeables to confirm the electronics aren't faulty.,Update 7.15.2019: The camera gets worse and worse. Kodak replaced my original one but I had to pay return shipping. The new camera has the exact same issues as the previous one. Furthermore, its recording of sound is erratic. I recently was at a music event where I recorded a number of short clips with the camera. A few of the clips have sound but the overwhelming majority have none. I just did a short test video and it has no sound. I have listened to the recording file with several different apps and on different devices to confirm the problem is the file itself--i.e., the camera--is at fault, not recording sound. So I am again lowering the number of stars I give this camera, now to the fewest possible.","February 26, 2019",1.0 out of 5 stars,B

The camera itself seems to be a good point and shoot especially for a teenage girl... if it would stay on for more than a minute.,The seller... I ordered this at the end of September for a Christmas gift. I was excited because I found this $60 camera for only $20 and thought I was getting a great deal. When I received it I turned it on and tested it out briefly. It seemed to work pretty well, however after my daughter received it for Christmas (three months later) and played with it for a few minutes it shut off randomly. At first it turned right back on then it stopped turning on and responding all together. We put different brand new batteries in it and once again it turned on but this time it shut off right away. We observed that it never showed a full battery icon even with new batteries. So obviously this camera does not work right and I immediately requested a refund. The seller, lotus media, refused because it had been more than 30 days since I purchased it. I wrote another email requesting that they take into consideration that it had been purchased as a Christmas gift and that was the reason for the delay, but they stuck by their “policy” and would not budge. I tried to file an A to Z claim with amazon and was told by them that I was outside my time frame for filing a claim. So basically I’m screwed. I’m glad that I only spent $20. Lesson learned - spend more time testing out electronics, a deal that’s “too good to be true” really is not a deal at all, and though I’ve always had good experiences with amazon I’m disappointed they didn’t back me on this. I can’t believe that this seller didn’t know exactly what they were selling and that’s why the price was so low. I’m sure they thought that was good enough compensation for the fact that the camera doesn’t work right, but this fact should have been made known in the description of the camera.","January 4, 2018",3.0 out of 5 stars,Laura Chandler

B019UDHT6U,Canon-PowerShot-Digital-Camera-Stabilization,Canon PowerShot ELPH 180 Digital Camera w/Image Stabilization and Smart AUTO Mode (Red),I bought this camera for my 11yo son's trip to Paris and he took almost 1000 great pictures with it. Almost all were in focus and image quality is very good for just over 100$. We also took the camera on a river trail mountain biking trip and got several complements on how beautiful our trip pictures were. Color of trees were a tiny bit faded but waterfalls and green/blue from river shots was true. Was all fine once I auto adjusted in software. It did fairly well with night photos in Paris. I like how compact it is and battery lasts a long time. Zoom also does not cause pixilation.

B019UDHT6U,Canon-PowerShot-Digital-Camera-Stabilization,Canon PowerShot ELPH 180 Digital Camera w/Image Stabilization and Smart AUTO Mode (Red),I dropped my first one off a ladder several times and it just kept working. I once shut a car door on the shutter barrel while it was out. I snapped it back in place and it kept working. It finally croaked but it wasn't from a blow. I bought another. I dropped it off a second story roof onto the first story roof. It busted into several pieces. It then rolled down the roof and dropped 12' to the concrete driveway and busted into more pieces. I put them all back together except the two lens cover pieces. They're spring loaded and I can't figure out how they go back on. Even without those pieces the camera still works! Though it still works I ordered another for a backup. I expect this one to perform just as well. I take hundreds of photos a day for work.

I can take ten pictures of the same item, just in different positions, and my brightness is sometimes glaring. Colors aren't standard in this same group of pictures and I end up taking them same ones over again that same day or the next day. Honestly, I don't have time for this!,I don't need a lot of features, and I don't need zoom. I take my pictures outside on my back deck to get natural lighting and don't use the flash.

B00I8BIBCW,Sony-DSCW800-Digital-Camera-Black,Sony DSCW800/B 20.1 MP Digital Camera (Black),"My old camera's battery clip broke and was not repairable, so it was time to get a new one. Since I'm a Luddite, still using a flip phone. As I had not bought a camera in about 10 years, my expectation was cheaper, faster, better.,Dunno what the heck happened in the digital camera industry over the last 10 years, but damn, nothing good.,Price - I figured to get something for about $50, since my last camera cost around $70. Nope; this one was close to $100. Some less expensive cameras out there, but the reviews scared me off.,MP - ok, this is a big change. This camera's got 20MP, up from I think 12. However, who needs that? Sucks up memory, and takes forever to load on Shutterfly. In fact, turns out my pictures were too big for Shutterfly and I had to squish them down. Yeah, that's not supposed to be necessary, but it's what worked for me.,Speed - reasonably fast turning on; about the same as my last camera. Not good - time to take a photo.,Two issues here. First, there's about a two-three second process from pressing the button until the picture pops up on the screen. After 3 months I still have not figured out when I can move the camera; not sure what the exposure process is. But I get blurry pictures a lot, so there appears to be some delay between pressing the button and being finished. Second issue - not gonna get many chances at a motion event, so time it well! 3 seconds minimum between pictures. F that noise.,Ease of recharge, battery life, pulling chip to unload pix - no issues. THat's all good.,All in all, this camera will drive me to get a smartphone. Or at least ask my wife to get me one for Christmas next year.

I always loved photography, and I have been using all kinds of different types of smartphone and tablets for taking pictures. While lots of those handheld mobile devices did very good at taking pictures, this SONY DSC-W800 beats all the smartphone and tablet cameras especially with the image processing like (exposure etc.) Also the 5x Optical Zoom is awesome lots of smartphone cameras don't have any Optical Zoom and the ones that do are very limited on the distance because of the focal length. Most new high end smartphone cameras have 1x-2x Optical Zoom which is barely noticeable. And digital zoom just sucks.

It snugly fits my enormous Canon G7X Mark II to the point that I didn't think it would when I first opened it.  I like that the underside flap partially covers the side of the camera so the camera won't just slip out if the top flap is opened.

It doesn't enclose the camera on all sides as there are small openings on either side of the top flap when it's closed, but it will absolutely protect the camera from scratches, dirt and an occasional splash of water.","June 15, 2016",5.0 out of 5 stars,Scott Davison

My only problem is that the lowest aperture the camera can shoot is F4.5 and the highest the lens can shoot is F5.6. So if you want your pictures to look fine af there are only 3 aperture stops you can shoot at (F4.5,F5, and F5.6). If you shoot at an aperture to high for the lens, your pic will look like the Palm trees below. A good pic but the lens couldn't handle the aperture.

It's pretty easy to use. It comes with a lot of stuff that I probably won't ever need, but they are nice to have anyway. I think it is a good value. The only thing that bothers me is that it depends so much on the battery being charged. There is no power cord to plug into a wall socket so that you can shoot table-top objects without the battery. You have to rely on the battery all the time. It can get tedious remembering ""Oh yeah, I need to charge the battery — AGAIN"". Down time. I was able to download photos into my Macintosh (which is 8 years old) without the battery being charged. That being said, you can't charge the battery while it's in the camera from the computer.

You can also download pictures from it and tag locations you’ve shot at! Super handy!!!! The small clicker you can hook up on the side of camera is great! It works great! It’s very short however. Use only when working with nervous kids so they don’t see you take the picture! The pocket tripod isn’t that useful for me personally but maybe a smaller vlogger or general YouTuber could find it useful it’s only about 5 inches high but it’s super sturdy! The camera might look to big but it holds up great! I use the strap it’s semi comfortable it needs broken in but I don’t recommend it. It’s rough around the edges of it but still usable.

Manual settings are available for almost anything I want to do, but I've had to refer to the digital manual a great many times.  This is no point and shoot camera, although it works great for that too.  I had much difficulty learning how to get macro photos without blurring, but eventfully got great photos. The macro-zoom is something I did not expect and I'm super-pleased with that.  I can adjust the lighting, color, focus and get almost any type of photo I want, though for general use I leave it at Auto-focus +.  I like to take photos of insects, flowers and birds, so the manual settings are of great importance to me.  I also wanted to do time exposures, and although I would prefer to be able to set long time exposures, the longest exposure in this camera did permit me to photograph the aurora borealis with the use of a tripod, and the touch-up function.  The 60x zoom is very useful to me and I've photographed quite a few birds already.  It is very difficult to hold the camera still at the 60x level, but using a tripod for a bird is impractical when they are moving around.  I have to take several hand-held shots to get a good one, but usually succeed.  I am very pleased with this camera and it is everything I hoped for.","April 19, 2015",5.0 out of 5 stars,Carroll Rudy

Stabilization, Touch Enabled 3-Inch LCD, Wi-Fi, DC-FZ80K (Black)","Pros:  Light weight bridge camera with super wide angle and ridiculous zoom.  I didn't have time to do a full battery of tests but I did test for ease of use, low light noise, macro, and OIS - I'm impressed with all of these.  The fact that this camera has a 20mm wide angle makes it worthy of adding to my equipment line up, I wanted something light for hiking so I bought the Canon SX280HS.  I'm marginally disappointed with that camera because it's slow and too noisy in low light but at the time of purchase I was pleased with it's zoom (25-500mm).  Four short months this camera was released and as it's the only light weight camera with a 20mm wide angle I just had to try it.  Despite the fact I can't just slip it into my pocket the FZ70 is very light.  I'm 6' tall and the palm grip doesn't strike me as overly diminutive so I can see myself carrying this around with out a strap and not experiencing hand cramps.,Despite reading a number of negative reviews, initially, I'm very pleased with the quality.  Low light for a 1/2.3"" sensor'd camera is better then I expected, in fact it's better then the SX280HS (same size sensor) I purchased just a few months prior.  The negative comments surround picture quality, I could not duplicate a scenario that yielded a photo of ""poor"" quality.  While the images are not perfect they are better, IMO, than other point and shoots and perhaps equal to prosumer options from say five or six years ago.,Cons:  Finding a bargain - This camera's price seems to be jumping around from the original retail price so be careful.  Thanks to the super zoom and the uninitiated's inability to get a steady shot there are plenty of these as ""used"" which are in fact open box.  Be sure to read the descriptions when sorting through the used vendors as some are missing accessories.  I purchased mine as ""used"" and it arrived with all accessories, repacked in the original box, fulfilled by Amazon Warehouse Deals for nearly 30% off the already on sale price.,Summary:  I consider myself an avid enthusiast.  I know how to use a camera in full manual, how to get a steady shot even with out OIS; in fact, I use a full size DSLR (5D mkiii) most times.  I will be using this for my upcoming vacation and leaving the bulky lenses and accessories for my DSLR at home.  I'll still take my jean pocket worthy Canon SX280HS with me but will use this for excursions and killing time on ship.  If you are looking for telephoto capability my recommendation is walk before you run - this camera is good but only if you are familiar with bracing techniques, manual ISO setting, and tripod use.  If you aren't comfortable with say, shooting in full manual mode go with a less expensive shorter range compact zoom.  Check DPReview's site for a great comparison tool.  IMO this camera is as good as it gets for size, zoom range, and low light quality.  Not considering the value of the total package this would be a good camera to have at any price point within it's class of capabilities so if it's not on sale don't mark it off your list.,11/22/2013 UPDATE:,Add some Pros & Cons:,Pros:  I've shot 354 photos, about 150 outdoors, some with fill flash and the remainder inside, most with flash.  I'm very impressed with the battery life, the display indicates I have full battery life remaining even after all that use.  My indoor use consisted of walking around at the convention center here in San Antonio for the Auto Show.  The cameras display stayed on for about 1.5 hours during the time I was taking photos.  Also I wanted to point out the OIS is amazing.  I shot most of my shots today, indoors, in manual mode most at 1/25th of a second some at 1/20th at ISOs between 100 & 400.  Hand held sometimes zooming up to 16 or 18x and the shots came out crystal clear.  I believe out of about 200 shots I may have had two that were not usable due to camera shake.  I don't believe I would have achieved this with my heavier 5Dmkiii with the 24-105mm with IS.  I did have to employ bracing techniques, holding breath, gently pressing shutter and using any railing I could find to lean up against, but no tripod or mono pod.,Cons:,Pano mode, while it works great, does not have a manual exposure control.  Indoors it forced me to use ISO2000 which leads me to the next con, poor image quality in low light.  I don't know if its a sensor problem or a compression issue as I was using jpg.  It's not terrible but even at ISO400 it's noticeable.  I had spend most of the day yesterday photographing my dogs between ISO 400 & 1600 while indoors and first noticed it but inside the house it's a bit darker then at an auto show.  I knew to try and avoid ISO800 but after today I'd say if you can get the shot somehow with a lower ISO setting, say 200 or the lowest of 100 you'll appreciate the results - so a tripod, mono pod, or bracing techniques are a must.,A side note regarding perception of the camera itself.  Last year I used my 5D mkiii at the auto show and I went unnoticed.  This year, with the FZ70, arriving early to the auto show I was approached by some of the presenters who thought I was the official photographer - go figure...,As soon as I knew I liked the camera I ordered a spare set of batteries and charger.  Considering how great the battery life is I sort of regret getting two extra batteries.","November 20, 2013",5.0 out of 5 stars,Paul S.

Stabilization, Touch Enabled 3-Inch LCD, Wi-Fi, DC-FZ80K (Black)","This enabled me to get some spectacular shots sight seeing in Arizona - shots that would have either required 2 hour hikes or just not possible otherwise were easy with 60x optical zoom,I'm not a photography expert, and at the moment I don't want to have to learn about / spend the money on a DSLR and all the associated lenses, etc - however I still wanted a camera that had manual features like shutter speed, sensitivity, etc so that I could grow into the camera over time,The electronic view finder is surprisingly useful to help get level shots,Tips/advice:,- If you're going to use manual focus, try the same shot with automatic focus as well - I used manual focus for a number of extreme distance shots that looked ok on the LCD screen but are blurry on larger screens, where shots of other scenes I used automatic focus and came out great - this means many of my extreme distance shots at the Grand Canyon North Rim were blurry when they probably would have been fine in automatic focus mode,- If you want to use manual exposure times I recommend getting a tripod, since I did not have one the long exposure time shots I took were just blurry,- Instead of having to walk further away from / closer to the scene, it is extremely helpful to have the easy to use and plentiful zoom control, even for close range shots (few inches to 10ft) - just zoom in a bit to crop out what you don't want and put more of an emphasis on the subject in the photo","September 12, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazon Customer

This is the largest camera we have bought ever (we had previous lumix point and shoot cameras, but nothing this big).  The Auto/Intelligent option works very well and we are very happy with the pictures we were able to take with this camera, especially in the Botanical Garden near Hilo.

Stabilization, Touch Enabled 3-Inch LCD, Wi-Fi, DC-FZ80K (Black)","Update: 11/17/2014.  I have used the camera for several months now and love it.  I really like the zoom range of the camera from 20mm to 1200mm and it is my main daily carry camera.  It takes great detailed photos and the noise levels are very good.,The is going to be a quick review on the camera and I will add more as time goes on.  The FZ70 takes really good sharp photos, but hand held might be a problem in lower light levels.  I went out yesterday evening and took some shots hand held and they all came out blurry.  I should have paid more attention to the shutter speed.,The camera works fantastically in iA, which is the auto mode. I mainly use Aperture but was impressed with the auto settings.,It will go with a 60 second exposure in the Starry Sky Mode, which is under the SCN mode on the main dial.,The lens thread is 55mm so if you plan on using your filters from any other Pany camera, you will need a 55 to 52mm Step Down Adapter.  Amazon has them for cheap.  I don't think vignetting will be a problem using 52mm filters as the lens is way smaller than the filter threads on the camera.  Here is the 55 to 52mm Step Down Adapter.,The camera has no shutter remote cord jack, so a shutter release cable will not work.  My Yongnuo YN-560 flash will not work on the camera either.  It physically hits the camera flash housing, which is raised a little.  The answer to that is to use a wireless flash trigger with the Yongnuo Flash and that works fine.,Addition:  I looked at the Yongnuo flash again and it will fit on the camera, but it is a tight fit between the camera flash and the Yongnuo flash housing.  I modified the Yongnuo flash by taking some of the plastic off the flash housing where the camera flash is hitting, with a pencil grinder.  It doesn't take much, and it is right in the middle of the housing.  You could remove some of the plastic in the flash housing with sandpaper, but it would take longer, but will also give you more control of how much plastic you are taking off.  Now my Yongnuo Flash works perfectly on the FZ70 camera!,The video does not have a progressive setting.  Interpolated is the best you are going to get with this camera.,The FZ70 does not have a jack for a shutter release cable and does not have an infrared input either.  The camera has to be set to a timer delay within the camera for 2 or 10 seconds.  If it was a Sony or Canon, the timer is set and stays on till you shut it off.  Unfortunately this camera requires you set the timer delay for each and every photo.,The longest the camera will go on exposure under the Shutter or Manual Mode is 8 seconds.  In the Starry Sky Mode it will go 15, 30, and 60 seconds.,Like I said the lens thread is 55mm so your filters will have to be that size or use an adapter.  The camera will use a teleconverter with the DMW-LA8 adapter, which is not available yet.  Addition:  Those LA8 adapters are available on Ebay now.  They are being sold out of Japan though.  I had that happen with the FZ200 camera as well and had no problem getting one from a Japanese Ebay member.  There are several teleconverters that work well with this camera, but may not be needed as this lens rocks as far as zoom goes!,Update:  An aftermarket adapter is now available for a good price.,It will take Raw pictures, but no one is supporting the FZ70 Raw files yet.  It will come.  Added: I found that FastStone will support the Raw files from the FZ70 and it is much better than Silkypix, in my opinion.  Just Google FastStone and download and install the software.  It is free.,Upadate: Raw for the camera is now supported in Lightroom and Photoshop.,Start up time is very fast.  I was able to take a picture in one second after turning the camera on.,The focus button is on the top of the camera now.  The AF/MF/Macro button is on the right side of the LCD instead of on the camera lens.,One thing I have noticed with this camera is the noise, or should I say the lack of noise!  The shots I took at ISO 800 and ISO 1600 still look pretty good, and at ISO 100 noise is hard to find.,The camera will zoom to 60X (1200mm 35mm Equivalent) in the 16mp picture size.  Setting the picture size to 10mp will give you 75X zoom, setting the size to 7mp will give you 90X, at 5mp you get 108X and at 3mp is 135X.  This is Extended Optical Zoom.  If you need more zoom than that, under IResolution, use I-Zoom for an additional 2X at all picture sizes and digital will give another 2X, but image quality will suffer. I took some shots at the 10mp picture size with I-Zoom on, and the photos in my photo software are showing 3030mm zoom and they look amazingly good! I will post a link to some shots in the first comment on the review.,There are two FN buttons on the camera that can be set the way you want them to be.  I set FN 1 button to Bracketing and FN 2 button to Flash Control.  I may change them as time goes on, but I find it really great to be able to get Bracketing with the push of a button.,I don't care much for the lens cap, and ordered a better 55mm one on Amazon.,I use filters as it seems more often than not, I end up with my fingerprints on the lens filter.  It also keeps dirt and grime from getting to the lens.  It might offer some protection in an accident too. I would stay away from Hoya UV filters on this camera.  I was using one for a while and noticed the photos look fuzzy at full zoom.  I discovered it was the Hoya HMC filter I was using.  I now use a Sigma UV filter on the camera and it works great with no distortion at high zoom.,The camera does not come with a lens hood and none is available in the Accessories on the Panasonic web site either.  It seems there is no lens hood for this camera at this time.,This is it for now.  I will add to this review as time goes by, so check back often.,Addition:,I had a chance to check out the high speed picture mode with the camera and found this:  At 2 fps (frames per second) all works as advertised and it takes 2 fps for an extended period of time. 5 fps - it takes 5 frames per second for 3 shots and goes back to the 2 fps rate.  I tried it in Auto Focus mode and the regular mode with the same results.  9 fps - Once again, 3 shots and then the 2 fps rate.  H Mode - the camera took a very fast rate of speed (at least 9 frames per second) for 9 shots, or 1 second.  I have since found in the manual that at that speed the picture size is 2.5 or 3 mp.  I forgot which.  That is excellent.  The last mode is the Flash and it will take 5 quick photos with flash before stopping.  That could come in very handy at times.,I really like this camera.  I like the menu system on the Panasonic Cameras too.  I have the Canon SX50 as well, and still have problems with the menu settings and I have had that camera for 6 months.  The menu system just doesn't make sense to me on that camera.,I did a shootout with the Canon SX50, the Pany FZ200, the FZ70, and a Sony Nex 6.  The FZ70 images look about the same as the Canon SX50, and in my mind better than the Pany FZ200 camera.  The last shot is a Raw shot from the FZ70 camera converted to JPG.  The picture files can be seen in the Comments on page 12, the 7th post.,Added:  After using this camera for a while now,  I am even more impressed with it.  It takes great pictures and I really like the Panasonic Menu, which is laid out well and easy to use.  I am getting lots of keeper photos and the lack of noise in the shots is really appreciated!,Addition 10-29-13  I sent the first FZ70 back because the photos at high zoom were soft.  To make a long story short, it turned out that the Hoya UV filter I was using on the camera was responsible for the soft photos.  I have changed to a Sigma DG 55mm filter and the results are outstanding.  Sharp clear photos at all zoom levels.  This camera takes photos every bit as sharp and detailed as the Panasonic FZ150 or FZ200 camera and is as good as the Canon SX50 in sharpness as well.","September 4, 2013",5.0 out of 5 stars,Rolla Gravett

B00HNJWUBI,Sony-DSCW830-Digital-Camera-2-7-Inch,Sony DSCW830 20.1 MP Digital Camera with 2.7-Inch LCD (Silver),"The first camera received worked fine outdoors but i noticed it was hunting and having trouble focusing indoors even in a well lit room. If I hadn't had a lot of experience with this level camera from Canon & Lumix, I would have thought it was my fault. I returned it and the second one has no problems focusing indoors quickly. It's just as good as the competition. Things I prefer on this camera to our Canon A3500: 8x vs. 5x optical zoom but with comparable f-stop. Simpler, easier to use menu system and a standard usb cable for charging directly to the camera without removing the battery. The advantage of the Canon over the Sony is the lens retracts completely into the camera body flat whereas the Sony lens protrudes a little bit even when the lens is retracted and closed. Also, the Canon feels a little bit more sold than the Sony. Overall, the Sony is a great camera that takes sharp pictures indoors or out.

B00HNJWUBI,Sony-DSCW830-Digital-Camera-2-7-Inch,Sony DSCW830 20.1 MP Digital Camera with 2.7-Inch LCD (Silver),"My husband and I really love our cameras.  We bought one for each of us to take on vacation.  They are small, lightweight, and take great pictures.  The resolution of the picture is better than what you see on the viewfinder, although the viewfinder is good quality too.  They are also very reasonably priced for the quality of product you get.  When we are out and about, I tend to leave my camera out of the case in my bag so I can pull it out quickly and take pictures.  It has been durable despite the abuse, and we've had no problem whatsoever with them.","November 18, 2015",5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazon Customer
B00HNJWUBI,Sony-DSCW830-Digital-Camera-2-7-Inch,Sony DSCW830 20.1 MP Digital Camera with 2.7-Inch LCD (Silver),"Nice little camera -- [UPDATE] it does ""burst pictures"" but not like an SLR would - meaning there is a slight pause after each picture as it processes the picture.  You have to put it into that mode.  It can do video, but I didn't get it for that.  Good Value.  Worth the money!  I do also wish, as constructive criticism, that there was an intermediate setting between VGA and 5 MP.  The pictures are either too small (150k) or too large (3 GB).  So I take pictures in 5 MP mode and resize them on my desktop computer.  I don't need the detail like some people demand.","February 22, 2018",5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazon Prime??
B00HNJWUBI,Sony-DSCW830-Digital-Camera-2-7-Inch,Sony DSCW830 20.1 MP Digital Camera with 2.7-Inch LCD (Silver),"Nicely designed camera and good value for the price.  Simple, intuitive controls.  Easy directions. Decent size screen.  Zoom works well.  Auto focus is excellent. Includes the charger.,Drawbacks are NTSC and PAL for video output.  No HDMI option.  No Wi-Fi or Wi-Fi Direct capabilities.  Images take a few seconds to appear after pushing the shutter button. Image quality was decent, but no higher quality than our Samsung Galaxy S6 and S7 phones.  Zoom images were about the same quality as the phone.,So, if you have a nice smart phone, this camera won't offer much additional.

I have an older model of this camera which is much better and creates sharper more accurate images, albeit less pixels. The body and size on this overall feels a lot cheaper than the older model. The video isn't all that great either. I feel like some serious corners were cut with this and it was assumed no one would notice. The only difference so far that seems to be a real plus is the battery life.

When the camera arrived last week, we charged the batteries, purchased a SanDisk SD card to store images on, and got a padded case to go with it. After batteries were charged we tested the camera and took several pictures to make sure the camera was working, and to make sure our daughter knew how to operate all the functions on it.  Nothing seemed amiss, our daughter was thrilled, and she was all set to go.,Upon her return this evening, we found out that the camera began glitching. The screen would freeze after taking pictures, every few photos. The second day she used the camera it froze and became unresponsive. Her teacher turned the camera off and on to see if it would unfreeze, and my daughter reported that half of her photos on the SD card had disappeared.  When my daughter took more pictures and tried to review them, there was an error message saying ""no such file exists"".  She then turned the camera off and back on again, and the device erased ALL the pictures on the SD card.,We have tried to connect the camera to our computer, and it will not allow itself to be recognized by our computer.  We hooked the SD card up to a separate card reader with USB port, and the SD card is functioning just fine.  Just empty.,This camera is a worthless piece of junk, and my child is now absolutely HEARTBROKEN because NONE of the pictures she took on trip were recorded, and she has NO pictures from her first trip to our nation's capital.  The reviews all said this camera was great for kids and as a starter camera.  I do agree with it's basic shape - the size of the camera body was just right for her, the functions were simple and easy to figure out, and the extra battery was a nice bonus.  But there must be some major flaw in the internal components for it to completely erase a brand new SD card.,Do not purchase this camera if you are wanting your child or family member to have a reliable device to take pictures of anything memorable. This camera should be taken off Amazon and any other selling marketplaces. It is a waste of money to purchase this, period.","June 3, 2019",1.0 out of 5 stars,A. Seaton

It's ok if you take photos in extreme bright sunlight, but anything else and it's not very good.,Worst of all is the horrible video mode which is completely useless. There is no way to stop it from going out of focus constantly. The Nikon Coolpix has two video focus settings, fixed and continuous, and the Nikon's focusing isn't bad at all, it only adjusts it when needed.

B07NQBQ9F2,Fujifilm-X-T30-Mirrorless-Black-Body,"Fujifilm X-T30 Mirrorless Digital Camera, Black (Body Only)","SHORT SUMMARY,===============,The X-T30 is, in my opinion, the best all-purpose camera under $1000 right now. The X-T30’s still image quality, video quality, ease of use, and good portability all add up to a winning combination. The only major negative about this camera is the lack of in-body image stabilization (IBIS), which is a sacrifice needed for both cost and weight savings. Arguably the Sony A6400, which is the closest direct competitor, has slightly better autofocus and a more versatile front-facing flip screen, but if you like some of the Fuji-distinctive professional features like manual control dials, film simulation modes, and clean output of 10-bit 4:2:2 over HDMI, you can stop looking right now and just buy the X-T30.,Is the X-T30 good enough to tempt you from your current system of lenses to the Fuji ecosystem? I made this exact decision almost two years ago. Getting the X-T20 in late 2017 and using it for a few months led me to sell my 2 Canon bodies, 2 flashes, and 6 lenses because I realized Canon would never give me un-cropped 4K video at a great price. Now, the X-T30 is a vastly superior camera to my beloved X-T20, so you might be next into the Fuji fold!,BACKGROUND,===============,I owned the X-T20 for a year before trading up to the X-T3, so this X-T30 is my third Fuji and I’ll use it as a second body for me and as a shared camera for my 14-year-old (I need a B cam for video and he needs a smaller camera to fit his hands, so we'll both use it at different times). All these purchases give me insight into a big chunk of the Fuji lineup, so I’ll compare it to both the X-T20 and the X-T3 so that current Fuji owners or prospective  Fuji owners can know where this new model sits in the ecosystem. I still use Canon bodies and the Panasonic GH5 extensively at work for video, so I’ll compare it to those systems as well.,FEATURES I LOVE,==================,Here are the major standouts of the X-T30 that make it exceptional for the sub-$1000 price bracket:,▶ 4K VIDEO with oversampling instead of binning or skipping, something that’s computationally difficult to do on a larger sensor like the 26MP APS-C found here; the X-T30 has the same quad-core processor as its bigger brother, the X-T3, so it can easily handle video tasks. The fast processor also makes the overall interface feel snappy and consistently quick (no lag).,▶ The X-T30 yields beautiful, low-noise 26-MP STILL IMAGES from the X-Trans APS-C sensor.  APS-C is quite a bit bigger than the Micro 4/3 sensors in this size and price range. This is the same sensor size as the entire X-mount lineup, and some sites claim that the detailed studio low-light noise tests show slightly worse on this model than its 24-MP predecessors, but in the real world I have found that the performance is superb. When paired with one of Fuji’s well-built X-mount lenses, the still images will hold up well to any DSLR under 30MP (and the video looks as good as any 4K camera PERIOD, matching units costing 3x-5x as much!). Check out the various demos online of the video quality, especially if you can download the original file and not rely on overly-compressed uploads like the ones you'll see here or on a video sharing site.,▶ Convenient HANDLING and extreme PORTABILITY: you can buy this camera and a Fuji pancake lens for portability that rivals a large smartphone (albeit too thick for most pockets), but with manual controls readily available at your fingertips that bring back the joy of photography. This carries over well from the X-T20 that I owned before and that brought back the fun I had lost after owning a succession of five different Canon DSLRs during the previous 12 years. The most obvious change is that the X-T30 eliminates the discrete selector buttons on the back in favor of a 4-way joystick, and in general I think this is an upgrade. The much-discussed Q-button placement that's now directly under your right thumb takes some getting used to, but you may end up buying one of the grips or hand straps that allows you to fully customize the ergonomics, so this is always a very subjective discussion anyway. Ultimately I prefer the X-T3 with a battery grip because my hands are pretty big, but the X-T30 feels plenty secure when I use a hand strap to attach it to my right wrist.,▶ Super fast, accurate, predictive AUTOFOCUSING in stills and videos (even beating the X-T3 until the T3 gets an update). I'm not a sports photographer, but I do have kids that dart around, so the X-T30 is a big improvement over the X-T20 and I'm eagerly awaiting the new firmware for the X-T3.,▶ Absurdly fast CONTINUOUS STILL SHOOTING, up to 30 FPS or 20 FPS with no crop; the buffer will fill up ridiculously fast, but it’s nice to know this is available, especially if you have a fast SD card that can drain the image buffer quickly. The image buffer is on the small side; don't plan on using the 20 FPS mode for more than a second!,▶ Unrivaled PORTS and HDMI OUTPUT for a camera of this size: thankfully Fuji has embraced USB-C for charging, and the X-T30 adds the ability to use USB-C headphones as well so that you can have a microphone (via 2.5mm adapter) and monitor the playback on the USB-C port. Usually, this combo is only found on much bigger/pricier cameras and it makes the X-T30 a serious contender for a real video production camera (as long as you can work around the 10-min limit for 4K recording to the card). You can bypass the time limit via HDMI where you can output clean 4:2:2 10-bit footage (with or without the subdued color F-log setting) that makes this camera on par with professional Hollywood rigs for post-processing and color tweaking. Most of the time you'll want clips shorter than 10 minutes anyway! By pro standards, a $900 body is disposable, so to get this level of color science and bitrate at this price would have been unthinkable even 3 years ago, especially for internal recording on an SD card. The Panasonic GH5 really changed the landscape when it launched 2 years ago, and the X-T3/X-T30 have continued that trend at even lower price points (with larger sensors that do better still images).,FEATURES THAT I DISLIKE OR ARE JUST MISSING,========================================,▶ Where is the flippy screen!?!? The size and weight of this camera would be perfect for blogging, but you can’t see yourself because the screen only tilts and never flips up to face the front. Canon and Panasonic have this figured out and maybe they have strong patents or another way to scare off poor Fuji. The autofocus on the X-T30 is great at holding your face, fortunately, but it’s still unnerving to not see anything when the camera is pointed toward you. My cheap workaround is to use my phone (strapped to a Gorillapod leg) as a Wi-Fi live view, but there's a small delay and it's hard to tell focus accuracy.,▶ Only one card slot. I’m being picky because no other camera in the segment has two cards, but I dearly love that feature of the X-T3.,▶ 2.5mm mic jack. Why, oh why? I get that this non-standard small mic port doubles as a remote release, but Fuji please just throw an IR port shutter release on the front and call it a day. Every video person has to buy an adapter to get good sound from their external mic! Maybe include a nice adapter in the box?,▶ No battery grip option. Even my old/cheap Rebel cameras had support for a battery grip, and this X-T30 is even smaller than those, so big hands may be really frustrated with the X-T30. Fortunately, my unit is always on a Gorillapod for stills or on a gimbal or tripod for video, so it’s not a big deal for me. It's a great size for my 14-year-old.,▶ Battery life is barely adequate for Fuji-brand batteries and terrible for other brands. Especially for video, you have to buy the fancy, expensive Fuji batteries because the knock-offs don’t hold up. The “S” on the 126S battery denotes some sort of better heat dissipation for 4K video, but none of the aftermarket makers have gotten the message on how to do this. Fuji even gives you a dire message when you’re using a knock-off, so consider yourself warned.,X-T30 VS . . . .,==============,Vs. the Fuji X-T20 (previous model),▶ A small upgrade compared to my trusty little X-T20. If you only shoot STILLS, you'll enjoy the new autofocus joystick and enhanced algorithm, but it's probably not worth the money for only 2 extra megapixels. The image quality isn't that much better and may actually be slightly worse in extreme low-light conditions (pixel peeping in the lab/studio).,▶ For VIDEO, the new autofocus on the X-T30 makes a bigger difference. Video autofocus is actually fully usable now. Also in the video realm, the image quality at 4K is oversampled thanks to the quad-core processor, so you should notice a difference in fine details and noise because the X-T20 used line skipping to get 4K from the entire sensor width.,▶ Headphone monitoring via a USB-C adapter. If you're using the X-T30 for video, you can now monitor the audio levels with headphones directly in the camera and check that your external microphone is working well.,Vs. the Fuji X-T3 (bigger brother/sister),▶ The X-T30 is very comparable in terms of image quality and video quality, so the additional $500 for the X-T3 is all about ERGONOMICS, size, and usability. The biggest exception is 4K at 60 FPS; if you need that, buy the X-T3.,▶ They've reserved pro-level features, like the battery grip option, PC (studio flash) port, and larger viewfinder for people MAKING A LIVING from their daily camera use.,▶ If you've got bigger hands, need more ports, want the best video rates (60 fps and 400 Mbps internally), prefer the larger viewfinder, or generally need the best Fuji has to offer in the small sensor space, get the X-T3.,▶ If you need the smaller ergonomics and want to spend the $500 difference on a NICE LENS, you won't sacrifice that much by choosing the X-T30.,▶ There's not nearly as much difference between the T30 and the T3 as there was between the T20 and the T2. It's a great day to be shopping for a sub-$1000 Fujifilm camera!,Vs. the Sony A6400,▶ The Sony A6400 has the same sensor size and is priced head-to-head with the Fujifilm X-T30. The choice will come down more to your preference for which manufacturer and system of lenses you want to commit to than the actual camera body. Sony, thankfully, now has a wide array of bodies in this size and price range, which was their differentiator until they disrupted the full-frame scene with their mirrorless strategy.,▶ I had this exact choice, Sony vs. Fuji, when I went to Fuji two years ago. I actually sold a Sony Handycam and Canon EOS DSLR (and a bunch of lenses) to buy into the Fuji X-mount system of bodies and lenses. I chose Fuji because:,▶ Sony's menu system on the mirrorless cameras confuses me. I've used Canon and Nikon extensively in the past and now use Fuji and Panasonic regularly, but Sony seemed to be way worse in my eyes. This is subjective, but it's a constant thing I didn't want to deal with. Ergonomics count, especially when you get used to Fuji's excellent dial system--wow!,▶ Fuji has made an all-in commitment to APS-C, the sensor size that's smaller than 35mm full-frame but also quite a bit larger than micro-4/3 (MFT). I went with the APS-C sensor size when I purchased my first Canon digital Rebel in 2005 and I was pleased with Sigma's lens choices (some meant for APS-C, some for full frame). I didn't feel stymied at all enjoying the good balance between weight and grip size. Sigma does have many lenses for Sony, but Sony's native APS-C lenses have a lot of feature and focal-length gaps. Fuji just doesn't make a bad lens in the XF space, and there aren't really any major gaps, which is a good thing since there aren't many (any?) autofocus third-party lenses for the X-mount. Pro-tip--Sigma can convert existing lens mounts for a price, so you may be able to pay for permanent conversion or buy an adapter if you end up going from Canon to Sony or Nikon to Sony and want to bring your non-Sony lenses. That wasn't an option for me, so I sold everything and bought Fuji gear.,▶ At the time, I was giving up Sony's better AF tracking, which has improved even further in this latest A6400 (borrowed mostly from more expensive Sony full-frame models). Fortunately, the X-T30 also has upgraded AF, so I think the Sony and Fuji options are now fairly equal, especially since you can get nice, fast Fuji XF prime lenses in either f/1.4 or f/2.0 flavors. The f/2.0 series especially won't break the bank and are super lightweight, well-made and SMALL.,▶ I am seriously wishing the X-T30 had the Sony's front-flippable screen for vlogging. Canon, Panasonic, and Sony have all figured out ways to do this. What's holding back Fuji?? The A6400 has a flip-up screen, but it's a little hard to use if you mount a shotgun microphone on top of the camera. You'll need a little bracket from Smallrig that moves the cold shoe mount over to the right side, thus exposing the screen to front viewers.,Vs. Micro 4/3 (MFT),Wow, I'm categorizing a ton of great camera from Olympus, Panasonic, etc. into this one bucket. But, if you're really starting out fresh with your next choice of a camera body (and locking yourself into a system of lenses), use this as a jumping off point for your research.,▶ For STILL images, the X-T30's larger sensor and higher pixel count will produce much cleaner, lower-noise images. It's as much better than MFT as the full-frame cameras (like the Nikon D850 that's over three grand) are better than the X-T30. The difference is that the X-T30 costs about the same, or often significantly less than, the MFT equivalents. The weird part is that even without third-party lenses, the native Fuji lenses are often similarly priced or cheaper than the MFT lens for an equal focal length. I very nearly purchased a G-series Panasonic MFT camera before going with Fuji, and lens selection was very heavy in my decision.,▶ For VIDEO, Panasonic is really hard to beat. Their GH5 / GH5S duo is just stunning. With in-body stabilization in the GH5 and a 4K-centric chip in the GH5S, these rugged little guys are amazing. I use the GH5 at work (and the GH3 and GH4 before that) and it's so cool to have pro-level features in a small, cheap body. I really love the auto-focus pull automation and the excellent stabilization on the GH5, both of which are best-in-class. Ultimately I chose the Fuji series because of the still image quality, and now with this latest generation in the X-T30 and X-T3 that support high-bitrate internal recording and F-log, I'm not really giving up much in the video space (other than IBIS). I wish Fuji would have waveforms built in, but for the extra cost of a GH5 over the X-T30, I can buy an Atomos 5"" screen that has all that, or upgrade to the recording version and record 10-bit 4:2:2 over HDMI with HLG. Wow, that's a lot of technobabble, but the price/value ratio of the X-T30 gives you a TON of options for lenses and other pro-level accessories that you would still need to purchase with the GH5.,Vs. Canon and Nikon,Neither big C nor N are willing to be serious about the mirrorless APS-C sensor size, especially when it comes to video features and native lenses.,▶ Canon's M series is OK for stills but still a joke for video quality and pro-features. You do get their excellent dual-pixel autofocus, but Fuji has mostly caught up in that arena and surpassed Canon in everything else related to video features.,▶ I can't even say that I miss the beautiful flash system that I enjoyed with Canon because the cheap-o Godox TTL flashes I bought for Fuji seem to produce the same results that I got with my expensive EX600 speedlites, at 1/4 the price.,▶ The only saving grace for C & N in APS-C is the availability of Sigma lenses, like the excellent Sigma 18-35 f/1.8 that I owned for a few years. I would have abandoned Canon's APS-C system and gone full-frame long ago (or just to a cell phone) if it hadn't been for these Sigma DC HSM lenses that filled-in critical gaps. I'm very glad that Canon is making such amazing full-frame lenses for their new R body (and Nikon for Z), but it still doesn't help when you want a small body with a 6-oz f/2 lens like my X-T30 and 35mm f/2.0. You have to invest $1100 in a new iPhone to get anywhere near this ratio of quality to portability, and the X-T30 is available at launch with this 35mm lens for just $999.,I've attached 8 photos of the X-T30 by itself, and next to my X-T3. I hope you enjoyed reading this review! Please check out my profile and see the other reviews I've written as well.","March 26, 2019",5.0 out of 5 stars,Steve M.

B07NQBQ9F2,Fujifilm-X-T30-Mirrorless-Black-Body,"Fujifilm X-T30 Mirrorless Digital Camera, Black (Body Only)","I sold all of my Canon gear recently and went with this great Fujifilm camera. With the kit lens, it focuses with incredible speed and accuracy. The stabilization on the lens is great for video work as well. There are so many things that are great about this camera but I can't list them all.,One of my favorite capabilities of this camera is the ability to use vintage manual focus lenses. With the focus peaking feature you are able to confidently nail your focus. This feature has really brought back the fun in photography for me and exploring the wealth of affordable lenses.,If you have larger hands I would suggest an external grip, I went with the Meike MK-XT20G and it fits perfectly.,I was not sure if I should go with the X-T3 or the X-T30 and other than the larger grip area I have not been left wanting any of the features on the X-T3 so far.","May 20, 2019",5.0 out of 5 stars,Jonathan L.

The Fuji kit lens 18-55 is an outstanding lens, this does make the package more expensive, but worth it - I think!,I have also always liked the colors that Fuji seems to be able to produce, In my opinion, superior to Sony.,A wise man once said the ""The best camera is the one you have with you"".,Now a days there are many cameras in this class that are all excellent, so far I like this one.","May 10, 2019",5.0 out of 5 stars,Dave

I purchased this camera to compliment my Fuji X-T3.  It's definitely small in the hands and doesn't have all the dials of the X-T3, BUT the image quality is just as good!! Probably one of the best compact cameras in the market for the price.","May 1, 2019",5.0 out of 5 stars,Eric Guajardo
B07NQBQ9F2,Fujifilm-X-T30-Mirrorless-Black-Body,"Fujifilm X-T30 Mirrorless Digital Camera, Black (Body Only)","Sold my Canon Rebel T3i and Canon lenses and bought the Fuji X-T30.,Image quality:  no complaints! Focus accuracy, dynamic range, sharpness, low light performance, and noise reduction are all noticeably better.,Body and handling: I’m happy with the size and build quality, and I think it’s a good compromise between size and handling for my mediumish hands and preference to travel light.  It’s nice to have a body and lenses that fit the sensor size and I find that I bring the camera along for family outings, travel, etc more than I did before. The lenses are perfectly suited to the system, and are pleasantly clicky and smooth. They are small, metal, and lovely.  I was surprised though—I do miss DSLR controls on the camera body.  All reviews indicated that the dials made for an engaging experience, but I find that I actually need to disengage the camera to tweak the settings, whereas a DSLR allows you to modify settings with one hand without pulling your eye from the viewfinder. The Q button is a bit of a pain—-I often accidentally bring up the Q menu. The menu/ok button is also a pain—-I sometimes mean to bring up the menu but click ok. The joystick is great.,Autofocus: great, but not perfect. It’s faster than I’m used to, the full frame coverage is impressive, and it works in relatively dim light. It is not 100% intuitive and has a bit of a learning curve, however. And while it is faster than what I’ve used before, it remains a hair slower than my kids.","June 12, 2019",5.0 out of 5 stars,L
B07NQBQ9F2,Fujifilm-X-T30-Mirrorless-Black-Body,"Fujifilm X-T30 Mirrorless Digital Camera, Black (Body Only)","My first ""real"" camera in a while. The image quality in both photos and videos is excellent and the camera is easy to handle. No rolling shutter in video, which makes a world of difference from other cameras in this price range and means you can actually shoot really beautiful video with it.,Overall I really love this camera, especially in combination with some of the nice prime lenses available for it. There's room for improvement, but I wouldn't want to trade it for anything else with the same form factor.,Instead of rehashing other reviews for this camera, I'll focus on a things I found noteworthy that I didn't find mentioned anywhere else, and only learned about from using the camera.,• No JPEG+RAW in Auto mode.,The camera can shoot in JPEG+RAW mode, which is my preferred choice. I will use the JPEGs to transfer to my iPhone wirelessly to quickly share a photo but keep the RAWs around for archival purposes. The Auto mode is a must-have feature to let anyone unfamiliar with the camera successfully take a picture with the camera. Sadly, you can't capture in JPEG+RAW in Auto mode. This is probably where you'll need RAW the most, because white balance and exposure will just be the camera's best guesses, and not what you chose carefully when shooting pictures yourself.,• Autofocus noise through built-in mic.,If you stick with the 18-55mm kit lens you won't have this problem because it has a very quiet focus mechanism. I bought the 23mm 1:1.4R and 35mm 1:1.4R lenses, and both have fairly loud autofocus mechanisms. Even when you use these lenses with manual focus, you're actually not controlling the assembly directly, it still uses the motors to focus. With either of these lenses, the internal mic is unusable because it will pic up constant focus whirring, which has ruined quite a few videos for me. The ST-1 external mic still pics up autofocus noise but less loudly, so you'll have to be creative and isolate the mic from the body physically and move it further away from the lens than the included mount does.,• Mobile app is poor.,The ability to wirelessly transfer photos from the camera to my smartphone was a key feature for me. It works most of the time, but the remote app is fairly poor. It's hard to understand and can take several tries and jumping through hoops to make it connect properly to the camera. The multi-select interface is finicky; if you don't have perfect aim for the checkmark, you are taken to a detail view with just the one photo, this is slow and when you go back, it is scrolled back to the top. After selecting a few photos and hitting transfer, sometimes it will tell you there is not enough room on your phone for the photos, and you need to start over. It doesn't tell you how many images it would have room for, so you just have to guess. Finally, remote capture is problematic. When you enable the live view, the connection with the camera prioritizes keeping the viewfinder up to date over taking a picture, so the shutter lag between photos is much longer than when taking pictures directly. This is pretty crappy when you're trying to take a group shot with yourself in it using your mobile phone, which is exactly the kind of situation where you'd want to rapidly take a lot of pictures to increase the odds of getting one where everyone's eyes are open at the same time.,The WiFi connection sometimes stutters, and it would be nice if the camera would let me pick what wifi channel to use, or if it could join my home WiFi network instead of having to do a ad hoc network between the camera and my iPhone, at least for remote shots taken at home.,• Microphone jack and USB-C port interfere with each other,If you use an external mic for video (you should) you'll have to disconnect it every time you connect the camera to USB-C. The connectors are spaced just slightly too close to each other to both be plugged into the camera at once. It would be sweet if they add a mic connector to the hot shoe for their own mic, so users don't need to have the camera door permanently open, deal with dangly cables, and the eventual inevitable failure of the minijack port plugging the cable in and out a lot.,• Q button,Okay, this one you will find in other reviews, but it's worth echoing here. It is very easy to accidentally hit the Q menu button. Not a problem for me, the primary operator of the camera, because I can slowly learn not to put my thumb there. The real problem here is that 9 out of 10 times when I hand the camera – in Auto mode – to someone else to take a picture, they will hit the Q menu and will get confused. There's now a firmware update that lets you remap this button and makes it slower to respond, so this should be somewhat improved.","June 22, 2019",4.0 out of 5 stars,Dirk Stoop

Believe the hype.  Set up the camera yesterday.  Slapped on my favorite XF lens - the 35 1.4.

B07NQBQ9F2,Fujifilm-X-T30-Mirrorless-Black-Body,"Fujifilm X-T30 Mirrorless Digital Camera, Black (Body Only)","I own the A7iii as my ""big"" camera. It's so great but its heavy and large. The X-T30 is tiny! I purchased it with the 23mm F1.4. Makes for the perfect go to camera for daily carry. My Sony will always go on vacation with me but this little Fuji will go everywhere else. Having the same sensor/processor as the X-T3 is killer in a body this small. Fuji color/style comes through so well. I would recommend a grip as the body is a little awkward to hold due to its small proportions. Build in flash isn't the best but having it on the body at all times is so helpful in a pinch. ""Auto"" mode is pretty much terrible but you don't buy a Fuji for auto mode. Fuji lenses are cheaper than Sony's and are easily just as good. Make for a perfect Camera!

Besides the lower price, I also selected it over it's big brother, the X-T3, because of its more compact size and lighter weight.

Look around and hunt down a better telephoto or a wide angle lens. It does come with stock versions however they just suck... They suck better than my vacuum... It's almost impossible to get a great shot of the moon even under the best lighting conditions. Other than that the other gimmes were okay, but really aren't necessary. You'll find out once you start to actually use the kit. IMO look into getting a colored lens kit for around 10-20 bucks. This will help with some of your nature shots and cut down on using Photoshop or other like programs for editing. Also, make sure to register this. I found out that the software for your model will be sent via a link that way you know what you need.","August 6, 2018",5.0 out of 5 stars,Jim O.

Stabilization, Touch Enabled 3-Inch LCD, Wi-Fi, DC-FZ80K (Black)","I had a Panasonic FZ70 digital camera for at over 3 years now & it still works, but not as good as before & I pre-ordered this Panasonic [FZ80] a few months ago & recently received it. It takes the same battery as the FZ70 does. It has the same CMOS sensor & 60X optical zoom lens set up as the FZ70. It has 18.1 megapixels & a few minor internal tweaks, including some sort of update to their Venus processor compared to the prior FZ70 model; which is suppose to create slightly better images. Photo qualities so far with this camera seems pretty good & on par with the prior model, FZ70. Daytime outdoor photos are good, but in lower light conditions, the pictures are very grainy...as expected. Indoor photos with the flash are great. Video qualities seems pretty good with this camera also...indoors or out. This camera has full auto & manual controls, self timer, burst photo modes, uses SD/SDHC cards & comes with a battery, but no actual external charger. You have to charge this battery in the camera connected to an AC outlet. I would get an  external battery charger[s] & several extra batteries for this camera. Battery life seems a little worse than the prior FZ70....maybe 300 photos with no flash & about 100 photos using mostly flash...not very good, but not really too bad. The lens hood from the FZ70 fits this camera too. You do not get a lens hood with this camera. This camera  resembles the FZ70 with some minor exterior cosmetic changes, but both viewfinders are upgraded which are much better than the view finders on the FZ70.  Plus, the rear viewfinder is now a touch screen type, something the FZ70 lacked & that viewfinder is still built into the camera & cannot swivel or tilt. Wifi connection possible with this digital camera & the wifi options is in the camera's menu. This camera can take 4K videos & photos. You can also turn that feature off easily. As with the FZ70 camera, you can use an external flash on this camera too. Really, this camera's upgrade over the FZ70 mostly is 4K video/photo, using OLED viewfinders, touch screen rear OLED viewfinder, 2 more megapixels, wifi compatible, a bit more cleaner cosmetically speaking & slightly upgraded internal Venus processor. Menu layout on this camera is as easy to navigate...typical Panasonic easy to navigate menu system. Really a decent digital camera, but still can take a good photo or video. A modest upgrade from the older Panasonic FZ70 Lumix & can probably give the Nikon P-600 or Canon's SX-60-HS cameras both a run for their money now. I would rate it 4 out of 5 stars mostly because it's just a modest upgrade from the FZ70, lacked an external battery charger or lens hood and photo qualities are basically about the same [not a bad thing there].","April 2, 2017",4.0 out of 5 stars,Stormy1

Stabilization, Touch Enabled 3-Inch LCD, Wi-Fi, DC-FZ80K (Black)","The challenge for this camera like most bridge cameras with small sensors is image quality, especially  because of its phenomenal zoom range which can be increased even further with reduced pixelization. But, with this camera, contrary to the implied suggestion of most ""professional"" reviewers, there is much you can do to seriously increase image quality and have your camera pull well ahead of other super zooms, It is done both by camera settings and technique. Additionally, by processing, if you chose to go that far. You will need to work hard in order to achieve superior results full of color, sharpness, contrast and low noise, but it is doable even without RAW processing, notwithstanding the stunning wide to telephoto zoom range. To accomplish this, work carefully with the camera settings, pay close attention to get the optimal exposure, keep the ISO down, get the ""hang"" of the stabilization system, use spot focusing and area selection, and then use a tripod, monopod or brace like a shooter as I do. Finally, to do even more, shoot RAW and in processing go after sharpness and noise reduction, perhaps with an add-on noise reduction program like Topaz which plugs into Lightroom. The results from doing these things vs not and just snapping your shots are simply huge and stunning -- night vs. day. Just a word to the wise, if image quality is your real concern.,Update 9/15/14 to my last comment,For objects in shade/overcast, I use ""Vivid"" +1 contrast, +1 sharpness, 0 saturation, -2 noise reduction. For objects in bright sunlight or bright enough and nearer by, I use ""Natural"" -1 contrast, -1 sharpness, -1 saturation and -2 noise reduction. I switch between the two using the F2 button by having the Vivid settings stored as a custom setting and the Natural settings as the way the camera is set up. Pushing two buttons gets me back and forth quickly. Still playing with the settings, but these are pretty ballpark.","September 9, 2014",5.0 out of 5 stars,Kimball Corson

Also, when zooming in low light, the auto shutter speed is slow, causing blurring images. For example, in events with professional lighting, such as a big concert, I could take decent pictures of the lit stage from very far away. However, for indoor events with no professional lighting, such as school events, zooming from far away would likely have blurry pictures, unless I try to snap only when everyone is still.","July 13, 2017",3.0 out of 5 stars,TLe

Also,the other thing that is a limitation of most cameras that offer a '3d' feature is the 3d is not very useful because it only works,at 'max wide angle view', meaning distant scenery, which really never has much depth. 3d up close with the differences in depth,is what I wanted, but it disables the 3d if you zoom in at all or if what you're looking at is fairly close. So the twin-lens cell phone,that does 3d actually takes better 3d pictures for close up stuff.,Otherwise I love it. The ring mount is 55 mm so it's fairly easy to use existing lens adapters and filters or get a ring adapter for it.,The camera battery life is great and with an inexpensive 32 gb card it takes a lot of pictures and a lot of video. The sound recording,is also very good.","January 20, 2015",5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazon Customer

Stabilization, Touch Enabled 3-Inch LCD, Wi-Fi, DC-FZ80K (Black)","I am having a good time using this camera. My primary use is to capture birding images. I want great detail for confirming ID. I am not a professional photographer and am not able to evaluate images to that extent, but for what I have taken so far, they do really well and blow up decently. Most of my shots are at full zoom.,It is a bit noisy when zooming. I am still getting use to where the controls are. If it has a primary fault - it has too many features and learning to use them all will take some time. I shoot in Manual and Shutter priority mostly and some of the control could be smoother. Learning how to manually focus is cumbersome, hopefully I'll get smoother at it and upgrade the rating when I am convinced it does all.,The manual is a bit complicated. Wish it was a bit faster (shutter/f-stop) but who has ever had a camera/lens that was fast enough?","April 11, 2017",4.0 out of 5 stars,J. Marshall

I guess for this,price point under $300, you have to give up something.,For my use , it suites me just fine.  Took a little bit to get used to the new AF macro, as I do a lot of shoots with macro.,Wasn't as precise as the older one when it came to the focus point.  Almost better to do MF macro sometimes.  But once I adjusted, the shots came out much better.,If I have to really nit pick, some of the button placements are naturally in the wrong places.,I have hit several of them on accident when moving around to get different angles on a shot..,Again that will be more of an adjustment for me, but still something for the manufacturer to consider.,I know they got a lot of things shoved into this camera, so button placement area is limited to begin with.,So maybe some of the buttons we don't have to access all the time should be recessed with a cover over them.,Overall though, I am liking this camera more and more.,Let's hope it last as long as my previous one.","March 18, 2019",5.0 out of 5 stars,IKECON

The menu format is the same as the DSC-W690, however, the camera is significantly smaller, and the zoom clarity proved inferior to the DSC-W690 in a side by side comparison.  The zoom discolored low light pretty dramatically. I returned this camera & opted for the DSC-W690 instead.  But this camera does function smoothly.  It is really designed for a small hand.  Bottom line is I missed the W690 so much I decided to return this more recent version of it.

B00HNJWUBI,Sony-DSCW830-Digital-Camera-2-7-Inch,Sony DSCW830 20.1 MP Digital Camera with 2.7-Inch LCD (Silver),"***UPDATE AFTER MANY MONTHS OF USE***- For my videos, this is an OK camera, but it dies SUPER fast. You need like 3 extra batteries on hand if say going out for a day trip No other camera I have had (about 20 of them in my life) has died this fast. The pictures are rough. I would say 3 out of 5 are blurry. I have to take numerous photos to get any that aren't the least bit fuzzy. It might be closer to 4 out of 5. Sometimes it's minor and you don't notice w/o zooming in. I didn't realize that problem very fast because I use it more for YT videos than anything else. Also, the shutter speed for photos is rather slow, but it's a cheap camera, so that isn't too abnormal there.,The pros to this camera are that it is small, light-weight and films video in the 16:9 widescreen I need for my online videos. IF I could turn back time, I would have returned this camera and bought something a little bit pricier and better all around. Oh well. Hopefully, I get a better one from Santa Claus :)!!,I love this camera so far, as far as what I bought it for, my You Tube videos and other stuff. I only used it one full day, but the battery STINKS!! My other cameras last 5x's or more longer. Did I get a bum battery???? I charge it fully and take video and it starts going down to one bar and done FAR too fast to be normal. I read reviews that said it lasted people through many flash photos and videos during the day. I'm wondering if this is a camera I can take out for a day trip or not. My husband thinks maybe I got a bad battery. Anybody have any issues??? I love that it doesn't change the lighting to an orangey color, which is what the problem was with my more expensive, larger cameras. It's all over the place with those, which makes editing sooo difficult. This seems to stay true, and the video quality is very good. I wanted a 1080, but I cannot tell the difference to be honest. This is worth the $$ in the quality dept. & it is a Sony. I haven't taken photos yet. I'm just concerned about the battery. If the battery gets replaced and lasts a lot longer, than I will give this a better review. PS- The size is great, but very tiny compared to my old point and shoot. In a crazy house like mine it may not last the year lol. All is good but the battery. I'm thinking that may be a defect.","August 11, 2016",3.0 out of 5 stars,Twinpossible

This is my first “professional” camera that I have ever owned, but I think it’s safe to say I’m not so much of a “beginner.” I’ve done photography before but I’ve never had my own camera, so I thought this would be a good one to start with. I got it recently and I still have the option to return it and I’ve really been considering it. I personally like having a little more weight in my hands when it comes to my cameras, but that’s just a me thing. I think the camera settings are cool so to speak - they’re more filters to play with than be serious with, but that’s just my own opinion. The continuous shot feature on the camera has to be the one I really hate. It’s basically the same as the normal shot - it takes a really long time to buffer and honestly that takes away the whole point of a continuous shot. I also don’t like how I’ll see the shot I wanna take in the viewfinder, but the moment the picture is actually taken, it looks different. This is especially apparent when taking certain creative liberties with your lighting. Also, the camera does not work well with motion in my experience. Either it’s too late or too early, again this goes back to the continuous shot problem. Also I was told there is a photo editing program that comes with the camera, but I have yet to discover it. I do want to say this, if you have never done photography before then this is a great camera to get you started. I just have a bit more experience so it’s nkt really doing it for me. The zoom, though, is amazing. I was in my backyard and I zoomed into my neighbors tree that was on the other said of the neighborhood, and the camera captured the leaf perfectly. It was amazing. Who knows, I might give the camera another try, but I don’t know. This camera honestly isn’t bad and is worth the investment if you’re starting out or just like to take pictures. It gets the job done.","July 19, 2018",3.0 out of 5 stars,Cha Cha

B07H49QWN4,Fujifilm-X-T3-Mirrorless-Digital-Body,Fujifilm X-T3 Mirrorless Digital Camera (Body Only) - Silver,"The Fujifilm X-T3 is a fantastic camera, I’m so glad I upgraded.,First a little background. I’m a hobbyist photographer who has been doing hobbyist photography for about 25 years since I was in my teens. My first interaction with cameras was my father’s Asahi Pentax 35mm film camera which he bought in England back in the 60s. By the time I started to use that camera, it was older than I was!,In my early 20s, I decided to step up the game and bought a Panasonic fixed lens “SLR look” camera. That was 1” sensor if I’m not mistaken. I took some pretty decent photos with that digital handheld camera.,Back in 2013, I told myself that I’d upgrade once more and take a stab at the DSLRs. So I invested in a Canon Rebel T3i which came with the kit lens, 18-55mm. I also added a 70-300mm telephoto zoom lens to my arsenal and used this setup for 5 years. I’d shoot anything from my kids at home, to dance concerts to archery events and really maximized the Canon in many ways. I started to shoot in P-mode for about one year and then mostly shoot in Aperture Priority Mode, with some shoots done in Manual Mode. The T3i was a great starter camera.,In 2017, I decided that I wanted to upgrade my camera and this is where things got confused. I looked at full frame cameras in Canon, full frame mirrorless in Sony, Micro 4/3, and APS-C cameras in almost every manufacturer, except Nikon (reason being, if I was upgrading in to a APS-C DSLR, I told myself I’d stick with the Canon). Believe me when I say that I had researched cameras for more than 18 months before deciding to invest in the X-T3. I then narrowed down my search to mirrorless systems. A friend of mines let me use his Olympus OMD-M5 for a few hours. Two things that struck me… How light the mirrorless was compared to my Canon and the ability to see what the photo looks like in the EVF or on the LCD with different ISO, Shutter Speeds and Aperture settings. Looking for the mirrorless, the search then spread to Sony (both full frame and APS-C), micro 4/3 in Panasonic and Olympus and of course Fujifilm.,I eventually ruled out Sony. I felt that the “starter” Full Frames from Sony lacked some of the better features that the other, similarly priced APS-C cameras possessed. Plus, I thought the Sony lenses were too expensive. Micro 4/3 systems were inveigling me but that small sensor capabilities in low light, even with fast lenses was a bit iffy (for me).,Eventually, in early 2018, I settled on either the X-T20 or the X-T2. The first feature that I was drawn to was the retro styling… the full manual adjustments on shutter speed, ISO and exposure. And the manual aperture ring adjustments on equipped lenses. Drool!!!! I was taken back to my teens when I was shooting on my dad’s Pentax and how excited I was to see how my photos would come out when I played around with different settings, not to mention the disappointment I would feel when I saw many over exposed or under exposed photos. For me, shooting on the Canon did not give that experience and while I learnt to navigate the buttons quite well for shooting in Aperture Priority or even Manual, the Pentax experience was always top notch.,The Fujinon lenses also appealed to me. All reviews I read alluded to how sharp images were. And the prices of the lenses, while quite steep, were still cheaper than some of its counterparts in other manufacturers.,I think in early 2018, I eventually settled on the X-T20 as it had many of the features of the X-T2 with the touchscreen. Then came July 2018 and I saw that the price on the X-T2 dropped to $1,099 a mere $200 more than the X-T20. The X-T2 then became the camera of choice. In early September, my decisions were stymied by the launch of the X-H1 as I began to wonder whether Fujifilm were heading in a different direction for IBIS. But I told myself that the lenses would be around for a while and that the X-T2 would be the way to go. Mid-September I was about to buy the X-T2 and while looking at a review of a Fujinon lens on dpreview, I saw a post on the new X-T3. I read all I could about the X-T3 and saw that there were introductory offers available on the X-T3 and many of the Fujinon lenses. Eventually I bought the X-T3 along with the Fujinon XF16-55mmF2.8 R LM WR Lens.,I got the new setup over two days ago. Configured the camera to the way I want it, including back button focus and some customization on the Fn buttons.,This camera is a dream to use. The build quality of the camera is first class and solid. My setup with the 16-55mm lens and the camera is a bit heavy, but that’s a price to pay for quality glass. The camera does indeed feel like the old Pentax and after shooting about 50 pictures, it is so effortless to simply turn a dial or a ring to adjust some aspect of the exposure. No more fiddling with this dial and that button and looking at a LCD screen to see the exposure settings before taking a picture, or half pressing the shutter button to see the same information in the view finder (that’s what I had to do with the Canon).,The X-T3 is heavily customizable. Every setting is easily changed from the intuitive menu. One small complaint is that some of the menu settings are not that self-explanatory or clear so you would need the manual to decipher what a change in that setting does. Maybe in a firmware update Fujifilm could add a little on screen explanation on menu settings so the user can understand the change being made without having to revert to the manual.,Which brings me to firmware. My camera was shipped with revision 1.0 of the firmware. I downloaded the latest firmware from Fuji’s website and followed the instructions to upgrade on the camera. The actual upgrade takes less than 90 seconds. So I would suggest that once you get your camera, perform the firmware update before doing anything else.,The EVF is crystal clear, and to be honest, there’s no difference to me in using this EVF as compared to the pentaprism on the Canon. I found that the transition was seamless. The LCD is fun to use although I have found that sometimes my nose would cause a change of setting, especially a change in AF. So I just disable touchscreen AF.,I tried a 120fps slow motion video capture of my daughter jumping. This is an awesome feature that I know I’ll love at those archery shoots. While the camera touts some impressive video features, only with time will I be able to unlock that potential. And speaking of archery, the 20 fps and 30 fps burst shooting would be great once I put it to the test. I did a few frames at these speeds and the camera was quite fast so this is another feature that I’m excited to use on the archery range.,The AF is spot on fast. What I love about how I have the camera configured is that with back button autofocus I can leave the AF in Manual mode but still have AF-S or AF-C by either touching or holding the AF-L button (which I have configured as “AF-ON”).,I have attached some photos to the review. All but the two photos of the X-T3 alongside the Asahi Pentax were out of camera JPEGs. The X-T3 alongside the Asahi Pentax were taken with my phone to give you an idea of the retro styling and the retro look with the silver and black. The photos show you the background blur you can get – that’s the lens mind you. But Image Quality looks great for out of camera JPEGs. The amount of detail is amazing with this camera and lens. Look at the photo of the lemon and all the imperfections you see on the skin! The picture of the willow was intentionally underexposed as I tried to show just how bad the weather was. And that chicken was on the grill while I was taking the photos. It was about 75% done but still looks delicious. You will see that there is a picture of some ants on an orchid leaf. Well for that picture, I was using AF-C mode. It was a challenge to get a fast moving ant in the focus point but once I did and locked on, the camera kept focus on the ant to the top for a few frames, until it disappeared or I moved.,I’ve only had this camera for a few days but already love the combination of the lens and the camera. I can tell that this would be a great investment. After 18+ months of research and dawdling, I am glad that I took the time to research my options and bite the bullet with this X-T3.","October 9, 2018",5.0 out of 5 stars,A.M.
B07H49QWN4,Fujifilm-X-T3-Mirrorless-Digital-Body,Fujifilm X-T3 Mirrorless Digital Camera (Body Only) - Silver,"I'm a professional commercial photographer, and when I initially bought into the Fuji system it was for personal use. I wanted a compact mirrorless system that I could take with me and not feel like I was working. Over the years as the cameras improved they started becoming my working cameras simply because I enjoy working with them. I now use my Fujis for most event work because I could easily carry 2 cameras and get the same image quality of my full-frame Nikons for this type of work without all of the heavy gear. With the X-T3, Fuji has addressed a shortcoming of the previous versions of the X-T line in that it now has a full axis digital level. I'm showing a house I shot yesterday with the 10-24mm on a brand new X-T3 (Shot in jpg since RAW functionality isn't available in Adobe Camera RAW as of this writing). The new digital level functionality allows me to quickly shoot something like this handheld. As a bonus, it started raining while shooting this and I didn't have to sweat it since the body is weather sealed. Otherwise, if you're an X-T2 or X-H1 shooter, the new features aren't going to dramatically improve the image quality over those models. If you're coming from an X-T1 or similar generation of Fuji cameras (X-E1/2, X-Pro1, etc), or if you shoot video, then this camera will be a very worthwhile upgrade.","September 24, 2018",5.0 out of 5 stars,Joseph Nienstedt
B07H49QWN4,Fujifilm-X-T3-Mirrorless-Digital-Body,Fujifilm X-T3 Mirrorless Digital Camera (Body Only) - Silver,"Firstly some background: I've been a big fan of Fujifilm gear for decades. Have owned (and still own) several of their X-series of cameras. I do a lot of indoor family/pets photography and travel photography.,Secondly, there are so many great and comprehensive reviews about the X-T3, that it feels futile to try to do the same. So, instead, I'm going to give you my impressions after nearly a month since purchase.,Things I really like about this camera:, * Articulating touch screen, * Electronic viewfinder, * Autofocus speed, * Autofocus settings, * Customizability, * Ruggedness, * Weather sealing, * Quality of nobs and buttons, * Image sharpness,Things that need work:, * Menu settings are still super unintuitive, * App sync and connection,Things that I'm disappointed about:, * Noise. I could rant about this for days. In essence, it performs horribly at ISOs above 400 (yes, even at something mild like 640 it begins to show some chroma noise). I have compared it with same lens, same subject, same light, same ISO, same aperture and shutter speed using an old X-E2, which is about 5 years old, and in most situations the E2 simply produced a much noise-cleaner picture. I know, the fans will surely cry 'don't pixel peep, just enjoy the camera' but that argument simply doesn't hold any water. You see, unlike other aspects of picture quality noise is pernicious and pervasive. If affects *everything* and there is no amount of Lightroom you can throw at it, if the noise it gets out of the raw file is high. I can hear fans also saying 'you probably got a bad copy' funny you should say that, because after a colleague got his, we swamped bodies and saw the same thing. Simply put, for a camera which was built in 2018 and costs $1500 it exhibits an unacceptable amount of noise., * Front side button placement: I don't care how delicate your fingers are and how dexterous your are. You *will* unintentionally press one of the three buttons/nobs Fuji placed in the front of the camera. I had to remove any functionality that was attached to them. It can literally stop you on your tracks while shooting something important. If you do get this camera, first thing you should do is re-program the front facing buttons to do nothing.","December 21, 2018",3.0 out of 5 stars,Relentless
B07H49QWN4,Fujifilm-X-T3-Mirrorless-Digital-Body,Fujifilm X-T3 Mirrorless Digital Camera (Body Only) - Silver,"Two years ago I switched from Canon to Fuji and haven’t looked back. Even after a brief fling with the Sony a7RIII when it came out last year, I discovered I still preferred shooting with Fuji.  So when the Fuji X-T3 was announced earlier this year, I knew I had to get it.,Now that I’ve had the chance to shoot both stills and videos with the Fuji X-T3, I feel like I can give it a proper review.,This review will be a little different than other ones out there. Rather than a nerdy, super deep-dive into the technical specifications of the camera, instead I’m going to seek to answer one question -- a question I’ve gotten DMed quite a lot on Instagram:,Is the X-T3 worth the upgrade?,Hopefully this review helps you with your decision.,Improvements over the Fuji X-T2,I was perfectly happy with my Fuji X-T2, but of course, my friend Wayne had to ruin my contentment by reminding me that the grass is greener on the other side.,He messaged me on Facebook one day and seduced me with words like “back-illuminated X-Trans CMOS IV sensor” and “quad-core X Processor 4.”,I didn’t even know what the hell those things meant, but I knew I had to have them.,As it turns out, the new sensor and processor are responsible for most of the camera’s improvements. Here are some of the key features that convinced me to upgrade to the X-T3:,•More megapixels,•Better low-light performance,•Faster autofocus,•Drastically improved eye-autofocus,•Smarter battery grip function,•Fantastic video quality,Let’s dig into these improvements and how they’ve impacted my real-world shooting.,*More Megapixels*,The Fuji X-T3 offers 26 megapixels compared to the X-T2’s 24. For me, it’s practically impossible to tell the difference at a normal crop, but those extra megapixels come in handy if you ever need to heavily crop in post.,*Better Low-light Performance*,So what exactly does a back-illuminated sensor mean for your pictures?,Simply put, it lets the camera gather more light which improves noise performance. While the Fuji X-T2 had a base ISO of 200, the Fuji X-T3’s base ISO is 160. Not a drastic change, but an improvement nonetheless.,*Faster Autofocus*,Some of the lenses that Fuji makes aren’t the snappiest with autofocus. (I’m looking at you, 56mm and 23mm f/1.4!),But put those lenses on the X-T3 and the difference is quite noticeable. Overall, I’ve noticed less hunting and sluggishness when shooting with those lenses, especially wide open.,Even better, focus accuracy has improved even when my subject is backlit -- a hugely welcome improvement.,*Drastically Improved Eye-AF*,Perhaps one of the most impressive improvements of the Fuji X-T3 is the eye-autofocus.,Admittedly, this very feature is why I flirted with the Sony a7RIII last year. While the Fuji X-T2 had almost everything I wanted, its eye-AF wasn’t impressive at all. Sony was the first to offer fast and accurate eye-autofocus.,You might be wondering: What’s so special about eye-autofocus?,This feature comes especially in handy when shooting moving subjects. As a portrait and fashion photographer, I’m always asking my subjects to go through a range of motions while I attempt to capture the perfect frame.,Before the X-T3, attempting to keep your subject’s eyes in focus as they move can be difficult. In single-shot mode (AF-S), you have to constantly move the joystick to place the focus point where you want it. In continuous mode (AF-C), sometimes the subject’s eyes wouldn’t be tack sharp.,But the Fuji X-T3’s eye-AF is game-changing. My keeper rate when shooting in this mode is significantly higher. In my opinion, the Fuji X-T3’s eye AF is every bit as good as the Sony a7RIII’s.,*Smarter Battery Grip Function*,I have very little qualms about the Fuji X-T2, but the battery grip for it was a major point of frustration.,When using the battery grip, there were countless times that the camera would shut off when recording videos.,I discovered this is because the battery grip doesn’t automatically “hot swap” batteries when shooting video. So if one of the batteries in the grip dies halfway through a video, that’s the end of your video. This limitation makes the X-T2’s grip completely useless for video purposes.,The Fuji X-T3 grip resolves this issue by automatically switching to the fresh battery, preventing any abrupt cutoffs.,Note: The X-T3 does not require the grip to take advantage of faster shooting speeds like the X-T2 did. The grip only serves to give you more shooting time.,*Fantastic Video Quality*,As if the X-T3 wasn’t already impressive enough, Fuji decided to make it a competitive video camera as well.,Before you scoff and say to yourself, “This section doesn’t apply to me, I’m not a videographer,” hear me out.,Video content is more important than ever. Social media platforms are prioritizing video content over stills and text. I’ve even noticed that more of my client inquiries lately have asked about video. So even if you haven’t incorporated video into your work, it’s something well worth considering.,Along with the ability to shoot 120fps slow-mo at 1080p and 60fps at 4k, the X-T3 also offers the ability to shoot F-log internally, meaning you’re no longer required to connect your camera to an external recorder if you want to shoot flat footage to color grade later.,Of course, if you don’t want to bother with color grading, you can instead choose to any of the built-in film simulations to your videos, including the new Eterna profile which offers beautiful cinematic tones.,So is the X-T3 worth the upgrade?,Absolutely yes.,If you’re coming from the Fuji X-T2, you’ll notice a difference in both performance and quality.,If you’re coming from any X-series camera before the X-T2, you’ll notice a HUGE difference in performance and quality.,Perhaps the better question to ask is “Who might NOT want to upgrade to the X-T3?”,If you shoot still subjects and are not at all interested in video, you probably won’t benefit much from upgrading to the Fuji X-T3.,But even then, at a price point of $1,499 (which is $100 lower than the Fuji X-T2 when it was first released), the X-T3 is an outstanding value no matter what you shoot.,Thanks for reading, and happy shooting!,Kevin Titus Photo,@kevintitusphoto on IG","November 6, 2018",5.0 out of 5 stars,Kevin Kleitches
B07H49QWN4,Fujifilm-X-T3-Mirrorless-Digital-Body,Fujifilm X-T3 Mirrorless Digital Camera (Body Only) - Silver,"I decided to commit to one ecosystem, and I dropped Sony. Yes, I dropped the FF A7III for a crop sensor. Right now I firmly believe that crop is the best blend of size (especially lens sizes), quality and price.,With the new processor all the battery grip does is give you extended battery life, there is no performance boost. With that said, I kinda wished Fuji changed the camera grip and gave us a larger battery. But since I have a bunch of batteries, i guess it doesn't bother me.,The features of this camera is amazing, it takes the best of the Sony A9 with blackout free shooting at 30fps, Eye AF that's close to Sony's science, pro mode of the Olympus E-M1 where it captures when you half press the shutter and dumps the buffer as you go so you can get the shot you want which is great for sports/action, weather sealing is even better... Plus I love the dials, if that's not your thing, you can assign those to the dials and custom buttons on the body too.,Unless Fuji changes for the worse, they won a permanent fan and I don't care that it's a crop sensor!","September 26, 2018",5.0 out of 5 stars,Vinh

The image quality is equal or better than the Fuji X H-1; the perfomance in lower light situations is very good; the value is stellar.  Couple all this with the consitent build quality and Fuji's commitment to keeping their products fresh through regular firware updates and you have a winner.  This time it is the X-T3.

That being said I just love to travel and taking pics as a hobby. My first choice was going to be the Sony A7iii but since that was on back order at the time and wanted something better for my last trip I went with the XT3 and ended up loving it. I don't make any prints and really just post to social media so this camera is more than enough by any means for someone like myself.. in addition the video is awesome as well.

B00I8BIBCW,Sony-DSCW800-Digital-Camera-Black,Sony DSCW800/B 20.1 MP Digital Camera (Black),"I own an older model of this camera and used it constantly for 6 years with no problems, but it is starting to have a few issues, so I bought a new, updated one. BIG mistake. The battery has NEVER fully charged after the first time I charged it. The settings are so confusing I can't figure out how to get it to do what I want. The software that came with it has not worked correctly. With the old camera, I plugged it in, it asked what I wanted to do with the pictures, and it worked. After putting my old card into this camera and then putting it back in the old camera, the old camera software no longer worked right (and all of the instructions, for some reason, turned to German.) I kept trying to figure out the new camera and kept waiting for a techier person to help me out with it, but nobody seems to be able to figure it out. It takes great photos sometimes and horrible, blurry ones more often. The battery is dead more often than not and I have to use the old camera anyway. It is way too easy to turn on or off by mistake--although the button is in about the same place, it is easier to push it and I turn the camera off by mistake in the middle of taking a picture. I LOVED my old camera (and still use it even with the small problems.) This one was a waste of money. I wish I'd sent it back when I ordered it six or eight months ago instead of trying to figure it out. I wanted it to be as great as my older Sony, and I'm really disappointed.","October 17, 2015",1.0 out of 5 stars,Amazon Customer

Perhaps the biggest surprise so far, is that my Canon glass with the MC11 adapter performs better with the Sony. Case in point is my Canon 70-200 F2.8. On my 7D, this lens only got sharp at around f4.5 in spite of tweaking the focus. With the Sony, the darn thing is now sharp at f2.8 - that's huge for me as I was getting ready to sell this lens and upgrade to the Tamron when they offer their native Sony glass.,Aside from lens performance, high ISO shots are simply amazing - even at 12,800, they are better than 1600 on my 7D - changes everything for me based on what and how I shoot. Though getting used to controls and functions will take a while, I love the customization that is possible and have already tweaked it with the controls I think I will need. Tons of videos out there on how to set it up - take the time to watch a few and it will save you tons of time. Also, don't forget to set up a control button to turn on the APS-C crop, instantly provides 50% more reach at the expense of about 30% reduction in resolution but it beats post processing cropping.,After 8 days in Sedona and the Grand Canyon, I am even more impressed. I exposed almost every shot for the highlights trusting I would be able to bring out the shadows with no noise, I was not disappointed. I have attached an example where the shadows looked black in the viewfinder.","April 23, 2018",5.0 out of 5 stars,DVAB

Ive been shooting sony since the 1st gen a7 series, going from an a7<a7s<a7ii<a7rii & now the a7iii. Between the first 2 generations there were limitations that i felt yearning for such as longer battery life, dual card slots & better autofocusing in challenging light etc. The a7rii did so much for me & was way ahead of its time but those departments i mentioned were still lacking & i had hopes of them being filled when gen 3 would be released. When the a9 and a7riii released i was excited to know that they implemented those changes but my pockets weren't deep enough to budget for either of those 2. I stayed more focus on the rumors & hopes of an a7iii announcement not nearly expecting as much as what was to come. Sony hit it out of the park and released a camera that blows all the competition away, somewhat cannibalizing their higher end sales, this camera fills in every space i ever wanted in a camera.  Granted theres some things that could be done differently, such as better touch implementation & making both sd slots UHS-2, however those may be wants for others but i have no gripe with either of them. For the large majority of people this camera can do it all at a much more (still high) affordable price point. Unless you have the need for 42mp or 20fps than this is the sony camera to get. It has placed my a7rii as my backup camera & am using the a7iii even over it for landscapes and portraits because the color rendition & joy to use has been improved. I can ramble on all day about all the tech features etc, but if you are looking at this camera & on the fence about it, you will not be disappointed.,Pros:,-amazing autofocus that covers almost entire frame,-large battery,-improved color over previous gen,-amazing lowlight performance, better than a9 & a7riii, about as good or better than a7sii in certain modes,-improved ergonomics,-improved menu,-touchscreen focusing,Cons:,-touchscreen limitations, can only be used for focusing,-only one uhs-2 slot,I have attached some images i have recently taken with the camera as well.","April 26, 2018",5.0 out of 5 stars,Zachariah Morales

It is replacing my aging Canon 5D Mark III, and it does that job well. The biggest benefit for me is the in-body stabilization (SteadyShot), which works perfectly for legacy and other non-stabilized lenses. Sony calls this a ""basic"" model, but it is far beyond what I would consider to be basic.,Now, on to some of the negatives:,The menu system is an improvement, in much the same way that a coyote attack is an improvement over a grizzly bear attack. It takes a while to slog through the menus and set the function and custom settings to make sure you never have to open the menu again.,One thing I love about Fuji cameras is the plentiful dials and knobs set to one—and only one—setting. The a7III has two dials that change according to the mode. Living between Aperture and Manual, the switches take some getting used to. This issue is not unique to the a7III, just something I wish was addressed.,Since I am primarily a Canon shooter, and Sony lenses are about as affordable as a kidney on the black market, I adapted my Canon lenses to the a7III. While non-stabilized lenses uses SteadyShot by default, my stabilized Canon L lenses prevent me from using SteadyShot, even when optical stabilization on the lens is turned off. While I understand that I'm complaining about a minor use case related to Canon lenses on a Sony camera, I shoot often in dark environements and cannot always bring a tripod.,Try as I may, I cannot think of any other reasons not to buy this camera without getting into detailed technical specs. The biggest issue I've had with Sony cameras up to this point was the star eater debacle, which does not seem to be impacting the a7III. If you've got $2k buried in the couch cushions and need an entry level professional camera, you can't go wrong with the a7III.","April 26, 2018",5.0 out of 5 stars,Kirill Makarenko

None!  This camera is the best in its price range, bar none.  It has nearly perfect autofocus, doesn't hunt in lowlight, and I have no issues with the color science (unlike some complaints in the photography community).,The bottom line is, if you are a photographer and workflow is essential to you, this camera is going to speed. it. up.  I spend less time in post color-correcting images, I have many more keeps because it nails the autofocus (unlike Canon where even if it should have focused correctly, it didn't), and it is ergonomically pleasing if you have small-to-medium size hands.,Cons:,-It doesn't come with a dedicated battery charger.  Sony, this is stupid! You'll have to buy one.  They are cheap.,-It is much harder to find equipment for it at the last minute.  If you need something, you need to know well before you need to use it.  Like flash, for example.  Don't expect to walk into your neighborhood camera store (yes, I still have one of those) and just grab accessories made for Sony.  Most likely you'll be relegated to buying them online, or asking the shop to order them for you (unless you live in NYC).,-If you use the adapter mounts, expect less stellar results, but still good results.

I use it together with my Xt2... IMO the focus and low light performance is way better than XT2. Definitely will be using the a7iii at night!  IQ is also amazing on the a7III but, I don't think I would say its way better than the Fuji.  Battery life is insane on this camera. One battery is all I need 99% of the time on the a7iii. On the XT2 I will normally use 2-3 batteries when I go shooting. The film simulations and the 56 1.2 on the fuji (Haha fuji shooters will know) are pluses on the fuji.  The fuji is also a smaller camera but the a7iii has a better feel when holding it.,The a7iii is definitely overall a better camera, but I am comfortable with the way I shoot with the XT2(I know the camera in and out. I know its strengths and weaknesses. I  know how to work around them) I plan on using both cameras.

I read multiple reviews between the A7R and this one, but due to my love for low light photography and shooting at night I leaned more towards the A7iii. Remember, I am moved from the crop sensor to a full frame- the price made it an easy choice to go with Sony compared to Canon, but note that when you start to buy lenses it will get pricey until 3rd party co. catch up to their comparable lens. I’m just a novice loving the exploration, and having a Mirrorless camera to see the shot before I take it definitely helps.  The picture I included has little editing done on Adobe Lightroom, and this was taken after the sun just set with dark skies.  (Long Exposure). I would definitely recommend the Sony 24-105mm G OSS Lens as an all purpose if you invest in just one for now.  Hope this helps!","July 27, 2018",5.0 out of 5 stars,Terrence

B07B43WPVK,Sony-Full-Frame-Mirrorless-Interchangeable-Lens-ILCE7M3,"Sony a7 III Full-Frame Mirrorless Interchangeable-Lens Camera Optical with 3-Inch LCD, Black (ILCE7M3/B)",I did extensive research into this purchase and have been very satisfied with my choice. I was unable to hand hold almost any shot because of my hands shaking. I am able to do hand held shots again! I have been able to get decent shots hand holding down to 1/8 of a second.  I had all Canon gear and when I decided to make the change to mirrorless I knew it would be expensive.  I chose to get the Sony 24-105 F4 G lens to go with the body and use it almost exclusively. I also purchased the Metabones V adapter and have had no trouble using my Canon lenses with the Sony body. I think I even get better results from the Canon lenses than I did on my Canon camera. I will admit that the menus are daunting and there is a big learning curve but I am slowly working my way through the process.

An affordable full-frame stills camera that can mount basically any lens on the marketplace, take incredible raw shots that are usable well past ISO 6400. And an incredible 4K video camera. The a7 III is a game changer, and I'm excited to see Sony continuing to disrupt the camera market and kick Canon and Nikon in their complacent keisters.,The previous a7 series cameras had a lousy battery that would die in just a few hours. a9, a7r III and a7 III have fixed that with a new battery design that can make it through the day.

There are quite a few things I haven’t used yet (like the filters) but the SD cards, reader, tripods, and bag have all been helpful.

The included bag would probably be good for traveling though.,I found the seller of this bundle, Photo4Less, to be good.

This were very good cameras but nothing like the professional Olympus system.,Based a lot on the reviews, I bought the DMC-FZ70 with a lot of expectations. Now I have to say that all of them were fulfilled with this amazing camera. With it, I can make anything I made before with my old 35mm Olympus and much more. The most impressive thing is the long focus 60x range . No need of interchangeable zoom lenses. With just one lense you can make all the range from a wide angle to large tele.,In addition it offers adjustments for deep of field, color temperature (with no need of filters), selective focus, image contrast, etc. There is a lot of technology behind this small and light camera that fits anywhere in your baggage.,The Lumix lense at f 2.8 is incredible luminous. With a firm hand (or a tripod) there is no need of flash during normal night conditions.,Other things from the digital era are new to me but I love them as the suggestions from the machine for beautiful sunsets, creative effects and much more.,The only thing I miss is the absence of leather case tailor made for this camera as I had for my old Olympus.,I am not a professional but I will recommend this camera for any amateur who wants a quality systems at much lower prices than most renowned ones.","September 7, 2014",5.0 out of 5 stars,A.

I ordered this looking for a good super zoom unit.  I checked other reviews and noted the mixed ratings, but greedy for ""zoom"" ordered it anyway.,""Bad News"" is much like what others have reported in that you are paying for zoom and one of the ""give backs"" is in the processor.  In order to get really clear pictures I find that I need to use my monopod to steady the camera if using more than a modest amount of zoom.  It is early days and I am still learning to use the unit so I will update this as I go.  I also noted that Panasonic does not use a ""named"" lense on this unit like on my other cameras, which may also figure into things. I also am aware that talent may be an issue here too so I want to tread lightly here for the moment.,The ""Good News"" is that it's a Panasonic.  It feels good, albeit a little large and the price via Amazon was very good.  The camera feels solid and the controls are well laid out. The view finders do a good job and Ai mode normally does a very acceptable job.,I want to love this camera, but it is too early to tell if getting the zoom was worth it.,02/23/2014 Update:,I've had more experience with the FZ70 now and it really grows on you.  As recommended in other reviews, I've added a UV filter and a lens hood now that there is one for the camera.  Not being the best at camera manipulation, I found that working through the manual with the camera in hand is a big help.  I also found that using the flash indoors helped with photo sharpness.  I am also in process of working through and testing my camera setups to be sure, now that I am more familar with the beast, that I am achieving what I thought I wanted.  In the end there is just no substitute for using the camera in a range of situations as, while it is no DSLR, it is a whole lot more than a mere point and shoot camera.  I freely admit that most of my ""issues"" with the camera reside with me, and by working with the camera I am learning to appreciate all it has to offer.  At the price point that I bought the camera for, I am really glad I have it.,06/13/2014 Update:,I wanted to report that I went to Everglades National Park a few days ago and had a perfect opportunity to give the camera a good outdoor test.  While at the main visitor center I was able to get some great shots of gators at a distance.  The zoom was incredible as I was able to get some really close in shots of the gator's eyes and hide.  Really a wonderful experience.  It was a bright day so the UV filter helped especially when taking close in pictures of fish in shallow water.  The camera did very well.  Earlier I tried out my wife's Cannon D40 to get a feel for a big DSLR.  For me I have to say that I prefer the FZ70 as it's a bit smaller and a lot lighter.  On the downside at zoom the picture softens a little (lens quality?) but is still pretty darn good for anything the average picture taker would want to do.  The more I use this camera, the more I like it.  At a $1,000 less that the Cannon/lens, I'm feeling pretty smug.","January 11, 2014",4.0 out of 5 stars,R King

Photography is a hobby for me, but something I really enjoy and an area in which I want to continue growing. The zoom and clarity is incredible.

The case is really nice with extra padding, space for the additional battery and cards, and a zip/velcro combo that makes me confident that the camera won't tumble out. I have not used the tripod yet, but it fits well. I had been researching cameras for months and this met and exceeded my expectations. I don't recommend for someone who wants the option of a flash since it only has auto or off. I don't use it for action shots, but it doesn't have additional modes like sport or portrait.

After going to several events where I needed good zoom and was getting pixelated garbage as results. This looked like a nice happy medium for me. Zoom is incredible, the WiFi option is awesome. I have to admit, I wish it would remember your phone with an automatic connection. You have to go into your wifi settings and connect it to the app to transfer photos, however after that initial connection, it works flawlessly to send photos/video from the Canon to your phone. Just wish it was a little quicker, absolutely not a hindrance to the operation  of this camera. It's also very easy to use, I'm sure some photogs out there would have their critiques, but I think is an absolutely great camera. Good for beginners and good for journalists as well.

B00HNJWUBI,Sony-DSCW830-Digital-Camera-2-7-Inch,Sony DSCW830 20.1 MP Digital Camera with 2.7-Inch LCD (Silver),"I have owned two Cybershot cameras before which is why I bought this one.  Clarity matters to me; I want to be able to see the pores on a cat's nose, I could do this with my two previous Cybershots, this camera doesn't focus on anything.

B00HNJWUBI,Sony-DSCW830-Digital-Camera-2-7-Inch,Sony DSCW830 20.1 MP Digital Camera with 2.7-Inch LCD (Silver),"At this price point, we can't expect miracles.  My other camera is a Sony a-6000, but the DSC-W830 was purchased as a simple-to-use camera for my wife--to replace her 2006 model Canon Elph SD600 (6 megapixels, 3x optical zoom, no image stabilization).  The image quality and noise levels are definitely much better than the old Elph with this Sony point-and-shoot.  But the remaining question is whether my wife should use this camera or her iPhone 6 while on vacation.,On paper, the DSC-W830 should be better: its sensor is 50% larger than the iPhone sensor, and it boasts 20 megapixels compared to the iPhone 6's 8 megapixels.  And the DSCW830 sports a Zeiss lens.  Using the intelligent auto setting, I shot several scenes using the DSC-W830 (lens at widest setting--25 mm focal length equivalent) and the iPhone 6 (29 mm focal length equivalent) and the standard photo app.  In the centers of the photos, the DSC-W830 images were clearly sharper reflecting the improved resolution of the sensor.  But at the edges of the photos, the iPhone 6 images were much sharper because of the large chromatic aberration for the Sony product.,I haven't tried out the P mode on the DSC-W830 in with various settings (exposure compensation, ISO, HDR changes, etc.), and I suspect that by fussing with the Sony camera I could make it perform close to the iPhone 6--in the center of the image with wide angle.  The chromatic aberration appears to be a lens issue, and I haven't tested different focal lengths (levels of zoom) to see whether it gets worse or better when focal length is increased.  The iPhone 6 probably has less of a problem with this because it uses a prime lens (no zoom).  Of course the DSC-W830 has the zoom capability (an advantage), which the iPhone lacks.,I tried out the panorama feature on the DSC-W830, and found the resolution of images to be so bad that the panoramas were useless.  The iPhone 6 panoramas are excellent--way, way better.  The SCN setting on the Sony camera may be useful, but the 4 picture effects are gimmicky in my opinion.  The screen menus are simple and easy to navigate.,Based on sensor size and number of pixels, I would have thought that the Sony camera might have been better than the iPhone 6, but overall it is equivalent in some circumstances and worse in others.  Did Sony use a cheap sensor and other inexpensive electronics? Is their firmware less sophisticated? I was disappointed in the lens performance (chromatic aberration, softness at the edges of the images).,I think that the Sony DSC-W830 is suitable for snapshots made by people who may be technically challenged--Aunt Ida or your 12 year-old pre-teen.  It is convenient if you are going to an amusement park with the family and just want some fun shots.  But if you don't need the zoom, you can probably get comparable to better results with your iPhone 6, particularly if you install the ProCamera 8 app, which makes the iPhone work more like a digital camera.,UPDATE,Previous shots were done in the evening, when conditions might have been less than optimal.  I tested the DSC-W830 in bright sunlight and with different zoom settings.  Results were disappointing.  The right edge of the image was blurred at 1X, 2X (equiv. to 50 mm), and 4X zoom.  I had thought that perhaps a smaller aperture (resulting from the bright sunlight) might help, or that the lens would have a ""sweet-spot"" at mid-zoom.  The blurring would be just detectable with a 4x6 print, but I wouldn't use images from this camera for any greater enlargement of the whole image.  You can have an acceptable enlargement if you crop off the edges leaving the center 50% of the image. One of the photos below (about 1/3 of the whole frame) shows the blurring on the right edge. I'm disappointed.","September 23, 2015",3.0 out of 5 stars,Ventura D

B07H49QWN4,Fujifilm-X-T3-Mirrorless-Digital-Body,Fujifilm X-T3 Mirrorless Digital Camera (Body Only) - Silver,"Switching camera systems is a massive pain and loss of capital investment. It's not something I consider lightly. I've been happily shooting full frame Nikon bodies for the last decade. Bought all the great glass to go along with it. For a time I lugged a lot of it everywhere and had a blast (I'm not a pro, just a hobby). Over time, I found myself calculating the hassle:benefit ratio and often found myself leaving my gear behind even on trips. I haven't sold it all off as the quality is still top notch, but I felt like I needed to find a system that was light enough to wear all day without getting in the way or causing neck/shoulder discomfort. Also, video on Nikon DSLR is absolute crap, have to manual focus most of the time even on my D850.,In addition to the above, mirrorless cameras have been on the rise (superior video, less chimping due to seeing exposure before capture). The current king of full frame mirror being Sony. I decided against the Canon and Nikon as they are inferior. So my decision process boiled down to Sony vs Fuji vs Olympus. So basically full frame vs APS vs m43. I decided to go with the middle sized sensor camera as the best compromise. Large enough sensor to get decent shallow depth of field and good ISO performance, but with smaller lenses than FF cameras. Compared to my Nikon setup with 24-70 its about 1/4 of the weight! The A7R equivalent is also about 3-4x the weight.,The Fuji Xt3 so far has been absolutely flawless. It's always possible to get a bad copy, so if yours isn't perfect, exchange it. Autofocus, far superior to my D850. Noise at high ISO ok, obviously not D850 level but useable. It's fun to use, light, produces beautiful images. Lenses are small enough to travel with several without getting too bulky.","October 6, 2018",5.0 out of 5 stars,Raistlin

B07H49QWN4,Fujifilm-X-T3-Mirrorless-Digital-Body,Fujifilm X-T3 Mirrorless Digital Camera (Body Only) - Silver,"I took up photography about 3 years ago or so with the purchase of the Fuji X-T1. It was right about the time the X-T2 came out, but because I wasn't sure I'd be that into it as a hobby, I decided not to wait for the new model. I've been happy with the X-T1, but when the X-T3 came I felt there were a number of reasons to upgrade and I'm glad I did. No camera is perfect and discussions based on brand loyalty can get pretty heated, but here is what I like about the Fuji X-T series of cameras. I feel image quality is very good and even better with the X-T3. I shoot in RAW format and edit the shots in Lightroom. Unfortunately, Lightroom isn't be best RAW processor for Fuji RAW files. I'm experimenting with Capture One's free Fuji raw processor to see if it's better. I'll still edit in Lightroom after I convert the files in Capture One. I like the manual dials on the Fuji's. With a quick glance I can see what the ISO, shutter, F stop, and exposure compensation are set at and can adjust them before I even turn on the camera. The weather sealing on the camera body and certain lenses is also a plus if you shoot in inclement weather. I also like the high resolution view finder for seeing how changing the settings will affect the shot before I press the shutter. Not having ""in body lens stabilization"" (IBIS) isn't a problem for me at this point since most of what I shoot is landscape and I use a tripod when needed, plus the lenses I currently use have stabilization. Not having it also keeps the camera body more compact which is a plus for me. Now I've only had the X-T3 for one day and have only had a couple of hours to take it out and get some shots. I use the bracketing feature a fair amount and like the fact that, unlike the X-T1, I can take more than 3 shots. I also like the focus bracketing feature, the last shot is an example. I focused on the moss at the bottom of the frame and the camera took a series of shots where it changed the point of focus until it reaches infinity. I then used Photoshop to assemble the shots so that it's in focus from the closest point to infinity. Won't use this feature all the time, but I can see that it could be handy in certain situations. Focus stacking is something you can do manually, but this makes it pretty convenient. I feel that Fuji makes a well built camera and have great lenses, but they aren't inexpensive. And while the lens selection is getting better and there seems to be more third party lenses available all the time (all of which are manual focus which I don't mind since the X-T series of mirrorless cameras offer focus peaking) I wish there were more options. Fuji has a roadmap for lenses, so it's just a matter of time and patience. I can't say if this is a worthwhile upgrade from the X-T2 or any other brand of camera that you might own, but for me, it was well worth it.","November 11, 2018",5.0 out of 5 stars,Kerryks1
B07H49QWN4,Fujifilm-X-T3-Mirrorless-Digital-Body,Fujifilm X-T3 Mirrorless Digital Camera (Body Only) - Silver,"Technically speaking, this is a fantastic camera. You will not be disappointed.,I used this camera on a three month trip to Australia and New Zealand earlier this year with several Fuji prime lenses. It does everything you could ever need and the weather resistant housing is a major benefit.,My main gripe with this camera is that now that my work is done, I had planned to sell the camera here on Amazon but Fuji has placed restrictions on Amazon to prevent people from selling it. This is not an inexpensive camera which is now sitting on a shelf depreciating.,So buyer be ware - Fuji has some seriously terrible things they do to customers behind the scenes.","April 3, 2019",2.0 out of 5 stars,Harry S.
B07H49QWN4,Fujifilm-X-T3-Mirrorless-Digital-Body,Fujifilm X-T3 Mirrorless Digital Camera (Body Only) - Silver,"Video shooters beware - when connected to the Atomos Ninja V, my Xt-3 freezes up and also sends glitching signals to the Atomos monitor/recorder.,Issues:,Atomos has sent me two Ninja V's and both experience these identical issues. When turning on the camera, the camera will periodically freeze. Also, when set to 4K, the Ninja V periodically glitches. Because both monitors do the exact same thing, this leads me to believe that this is a rooted Xt-3 issue. To be clear, when not using an external monitor, I haven't had any issues with my Xt-3.,Conclusions:,Both firmwares on both products are up to date. I'm suing supported HDMI cables and SSD's - and yet the problem persists. Either I have a defected Xt-3 unit, or Fujifilm needs to update the firmware functionality when outputting. If Fujifilm sends me another camera or updates the firmware, I'll update my review accordingly. I truly wish I could give it 5 stars, but for my video needs the camera freezing up and glitching (when using Ninja V)  is too unreliable to take on productions. I love Fujifilm and hope this issue can get sorted out. As a professional cinematographer and director, I can't justify having unreliable tools on my sets. I'll be returning my Xt-3 and hopefully will hear back from Fujifilm to update this review.","December 6, 2018",2.0 out of 5 stars,Howie

What i learned: Weather sealed includes only the front of the camera, camera back (screen, buttons) and dials are NOT weather protected. Be careful and act accordingly. Anything more than a single raindrop should make u Very nervous. I had this verified by a Fuji pro photographer on Instagram .,Anyway, this camera is so much different than the XT2! It’s face detection and processing speed is noticeably better. Many fewer blurred photos due to slow autofocus on moving faces. The touch screen is an improvement and there are lots of new controls to learn but all for the better, really. Photos I’ve included are not edited.

The image quality is outstanding and the new autofocus is much faster than Xt2 and perhaps a just bit slower than Sony A7. Xt3 improved all aspects of Xt2 but alas battery performance is only marginally improved from XT2. The image quality is equivalent to even full frame cameras. The video capabilities are better than all the others in this category. Image quality, autofocus and ease of use are all the reasons to buy this camera and battery performance only reason to buy Sony.

They both have great sensor, great for still, but Fuji have autofocus speed problem and lag on touch screen on their camera in general (before XT3), but they have great jpg color and great quality and compact lens for their APSC X mount. XT20 is great size for me but I will need to accept those points.,On the other side Sony A6400 is top of line on autofocus, but I do not like how their jpg looks like (yes, you can just shoot RAW all the time) but factor that you will need to spend more time just try the match up the color or make the color to the one you like. Also vs to the size and quality of the lens is big different, yes, you still can have great quality lens for of from Sony, but it will be too big and way more expensive than Fuji's X mount system. So I didn't count on Sony.,Than XT30 comes out with great size and the fastest autofoucs on Fuji (comes from XT3) even almost some as Sony and yet this is new camera vs to old version XT20 from few years ago, so it's system can be able to upgrade for more time than XT20. And the company who provide and take care of their camera system software update will be Fuji (you can google it and see). APSC camera is their main product and they do take care of it very well. So I buy it, and man it did not let me down. The size is perfect and I put it into my new bag PeakDesign 5L bag it just fit great and I can even carry my daily stuff with me without looks like a carry a lunch box of camera bag.,But really, go to youtube to watch more review on this and see did this camera is what you really need is more important than anything.","May 21, 2019",5.0 out of 5 stars,Jimmy

There are so many options and there is so much customization avoidable that the camera is a little overwhelming. But once you get dialed-in, it's one heck of a camera. Don't give up.

Apparently, Sony would have to classify it as a video camera and pay extra tariffs in Europe if they let it record over 30 minutes. So to avoid the expense, they programmed it to stop recording. Other companies, like Panasonic, are wiling to shell out the extra fees so their customers can record over 30 minute videos.,Did some research to see what I could do before sending it back; there was software for the previous Sony cameras that would bypass the 30 minute time limit, but Sony has blocked all third party software. So, I purchased an Atomos screen recorder for $1200.. Waste of money, because it doesn't record sound. I could've purchased a microphone and a mixer, etc, but going through all this trouble just to record an hour long event isn't worth it to me.. Plus, if you mount the microphone on the camera, the Atomos screen recorder is super loud and the mic would pick up all the feedback from the fan.,Ended up sending this camera back and going with Panasonic GH5S.

The a7iii is by far the best camera I have used on these three platforms. I previously owned and still use the Sony a6300 which was great for a budget camera but had tons of issues for someone who shoots professionally. I primarily shoot weddings and sports but also do commercial level work on the side. The photos I have provided are my first test of the a7iii in a somewhat warm climate doing both photo and video.,Improved Features:,1. IN CAMERA PROXIES... no one talks about this on youtube!!,2. dual card recording ability, dual writing ability,3. HLG color space, no overheating,4. Bright and Beautiful monitor, focus peaking, customizable buttons, uncompressed RAW photo capability, a large buffer depending on card size, and great autofocus with eye AF and face tracking... plus better ""color science."" Color science means absolutely nothing unless you are delivering a final image or video straight out of the camera, its all subjective and if you want Accurate colors Sony is the way to go. I could rant for pages about ""color science."",5. Headphone Jack... Monitoring external audio is absolutely important if you are running wireless mics. I will use this to monitor my wedding ceremony Audio.,Things that could be improved:,1. The EVF is not calibrated color wise to match the display screen on the back of the camera... not a huge deal for video but it can get annoying for photo. Know your settings well enough to get you close in photos, and the RAW capabilities in Lightroom will give you some leeway.,2. No face tracking while using an external recorder AND recording in Camera. If you record solely on the external recorder you can still retain face tracking which is not a huge deal, there is an option in the settings but it turns the external screen black.,3. only 1 UHS-II slot. I would love to see two of them.,4. no 10-bit color depth... this is probably coming on the a7siii which I understand, but it would be incredible to get a firmware update on the a7iii, a7riii, and a9 to allow 10-bit color, making SLOG  and HLG way easier to expose for and work with in post. Also, it allows creators to keep their a7iii and purchase an a7siii to match perfectly with it.,5. The shutter button is a little spongy... not a huge complaint here because I am being rather critical,The a7iii has improved almost all of the issues thus far I have experienced with Sony APS-C Cameras. In my example photos and videos, I used the 70-200 f/2.8 GM (incredible lens). The a7iii lasted 4.5 hours of continuous video and photo shooting to two different SD cards with a completely bright viewfinder and screen with 20% battery to spare... something I could only dream of on the 6300. This is absolutely a professional camera and is reasonably priced for the features it has.,if you are looking for a prosumer camera with pro features... you can't go wrong with the a7iii. It definitely is not a cinema camera but will absolutely serve me well until I need to upgrade in the future for both photo and video.","March 5, 2019",5.0 out of 5 stars,Alicia Keys
B07B43WPVK,Sony-Full-Frame-Mirrorless-Interchangeable-Lens-ILCE7M3,"Sony a7 III Full-Frame Mirrorless Interchangeable-Lens Camera Optical with 3-Inch LCD, Black (ILCE7M3/B)","Compared to the 2 Canon DSLRs I have owned in the past, it blows them out of the water in terms of auto focus speed and accuracy. For low light, I've never seen anything like it in the consumer market, not counting the A7s ii which I haven't tried yet. The version that I bought came with the kit lens and it's performance is fine. It's not the best to use for the ultimate low light capabilities, but it's reliable enough. Interestingly enough, the kit lens even has firmware that you can update. I have successfully used my Canon glass with it using a Simga MC-11 adapter. The Canon 17-40mm f4L and Canon 70-200 f2.8L focused quickly. My Sigma 8-16mm lens focused well, though it's meant for APS-C sensors. Oddly enough my Canon 50mm 1.4 paired with the A7iii and Sigma MC-11 takes about a minute or two before the aperature control is functional but once it kicks in, this combo turns night into day. I also use a 35mm 1.8 OSS Sony lens that I used with my a5100 and even though it puts it into APS-C mode which sacrifices quality, it's still good enough.,I can even use my Canon 580ex ii successfully with this (manual mode/no HSS) with a Fomex flash trigger.,The reason I bought this however was for video. 4k is stunning, though I have to say, plan for paying a but extra for a UHS-II card to get it to work. The S&Q setting is nice for switching over to slow-mo very quickly.,The menu system is a bit much but at least it includes a lot of features that are missing with Canon. Battery performance is quite incredible.,Overall, I can't see why this camera wouldn't satisfy most pros unless they work in a harsh environment in which case, the weather sealing probably won't be enough. The compact size of it though is nice when you don't want to draw attention.","August 27, 2018",5.0 out of 5 stars,Thomas

The 60x zoom is just incredible.  In both sunny and overcast I get perfect pictures.  I've used it for friend's child who is in a university marching band, we sit about 20 rows up on the side of the end zone and I am able to get super sharp close-ups of anyone on the field.  I'm sure many parents know the feeling of when trying to take these kind of pictures with your phone and your loved one ends up a tiny ant in the picture.,I would not count on this camera as much indoors and definitely not in low light.  But for sunny and overcast outdoor, possibly well lit indoor arenas, it doesn't matter where you are sitting, the reach will give you great pics.,I was concerned initially as some reviewers would say things like ""better hope its not cloudy with a camera like that!"".  But I have several times gone full zoom in overcast skies and ISO doesn't budge above 80/100.  The stability and being seated or using a string tripod can boost even more.,Another advantage is that some venues, like college football do not allow ""professional cameras"" or cameras with lens over a certain length.  This cam is a pretty safe to get into a stadium as is clearly for amateurs and retracted, is quite unassuming.,If you accept it for what it is, it is a wonderful camera to make sure you always capture those moments and capture them up close and personal no matter you are seated.","October 12, 2018",5.0 out of 5 stars,Lee

My Fujifilm camera (which is a 30x optical super zoom camera) had trouble focusing at times when taking indoor shots and some outdoor shots.  This camera had no focusing problems in Intelligent auto worthy of reporting.,I also found the white balance on this camera to be a step above my Fujifilm S4000.  It required me to use my flash more indoors so it could focus and that wasn't so much of an issue with the Panasonic LUMIX DMC-FZ70.  It took several indoor shots without the need for a flash and it had real time focus creating images that were sharp and clear.,On the long end of the optical zoom I did notice some noise in the image, but that's to be expected with a lens this powerful.  It performed very well in high range zoom and in both video and picture taking modes.  It's ability to focus in real time during video mode is pretty good and I tested it during a snow storm just to make it a little harder on the camera.,It's been boasted online that you can extend the zoom range on this camera by scaling down megapixel setting.  It does say that in the manual, but I haven't tested that feature.  What I do like about this camera however, is that on the low end of zoom at 20mm, it lets you take a wider shot than other cameras in it's class and some of them even cost more than this camera.,Would it be nice if it had a larger sensor?  Perhaps, but I haven't really seen any super zoom camera's that compete with it that have a larger sensor anyway.  That's probably more for an expensive DSLR anyway.  Besides, this camera takes pretty good pictures without the larger sensor.  Overall, I'm very satisfied with it and it's sure better than my old FUJI in every way.,I don't know if my opinion counts for anything but I can tell you this is a pretty nice camera.  I'm glad I bought it and I'm thoroughly happy with it and I bet there's a good chance you will be to.  For it's ability, features, and performance, I would say this camera is the best overall value of any camera in it's class being sold today, but that's just one mans opinion.,One thing I almost forgot to mention in closing, is that it has a 55mm thread at the end of the lens so you can attach filters for special effects.  That's awesome.  For example, if you wanted to add a Sepia filter you might be able to make your pictures look like they were taken way back in the late 1800's.  It's an awesome special effect.,Take care ... and I hope you buy this camera.","November 26, 2013",5.0 out of 5 stars,Todd M. Powley

All the other gear with it is crap. What I don't like about legitimate DSLRs is their lack of flexibility. I've been able to take a bigger verity of shots with a point and shoot than with this.

The screen covers were of such awful quality that after barely putting one edge on my camera, I had a doubt, tried to take it off, and spent the next hour carefully scraping away the adhesive that cemented itself to the camera.,I dont feel comfortable even thinking about putting the extra battery that came with it in the charger, much less the camera considering how generic it looks. The same can be said of the little ""tripod"" stand with legs so short it can barely stand on its own as well as the ""stabilization brace"" which appears to be more awkward than useful.,In any case, the camera itself is an authentic Canon and of great quality, but the extras are things you're probably better off buying from other places to get real quality versus a low budget ""bundle"" where you end up paying for things you cant even really use.","August 3, 2018",3.0 out of 5 stars,The Fox

First thing I noticed is the camera is double boxed with a bubble mailer in between the two boxes to keep it from moving. Inside the box with the camera and accessories were plenty of packaging peanuts to protect the inner contents. The price point alone is worth the camera so the fact that they include all the accessories is enough to recommend this to anyone looking for a starter camera. I turned it on to make sure it was functioning fine and it was perfect and seemed easy to use. Accessories that are included are a travel charger, screen protector, travel case, extra battery, an SD card, wiping cloth, a care kit, a small tripod stand, and a usb SD card reader for easy access to plug into any computer/device that supports USB input.

Camera came with a few accessories which was an added bonus including an extra battery & charger unit. Did not perform well under low light despite the onboard flash.

B07H49QWN4,Fujifilm-X-T3-Mirrorless-Digital-Body,Fujifilm X-T3 Mirrorless Digital Camera (Body Only) - Silver,"A camera is a tool. In my world, that is.  Not a gizmo or a grown up toy, a tool. I cannot keep up new products or enjoy the sensation of having one’s equipment obsolete two years later.,Forcing the wrong tool to be a surrogate or having an insufficient one, for lack of a better term, sucks tuckus, can be so distracting your productivity is slashed and often negates the positive flow of creativity. Sure, millions of amazing photographs have been taken with terrible cameras, but the aresnal of options with this here X-T3 makes it much easier to do what I find most difficult, capturing what I see in my head and getting it on film... pseudo film.,Megapixels are cute. The configuration possibilities infinite. Metering and autofocus lovely. Design impeccable. Rugged. All boxes checked.,Here is why I’m totally floored by the X-T3....,FINALLY, a digital camera I can use without pining for my F3. I earned my degree in Photojournalism shooting endless rolls of TRI-X, T-Max 3200, actual slide film (great way to learn how film sees light at eight bucks a roll) and color negative when required.,To me, digital cameras were horrible until the D700 opened my, ahem, eyes. Blunt, insufficient useless tools. Convenient, sure, but hamfisted and simply not worth it. After living, eating, sleeping and having a blissful love affair with an 8008s, the F3 + MD-4 combo and then the F5, how could I take fifty steps back? Shutter button delay. Remember that? DX cropping? Befuddling. My 85mm is now what? Destroyed my flow. The D700, an FX body + grip that broke my AMEX (grip a must) felt good ten years ago. Obsolete eight years ago. I’ve been nursing it, but we fell out of synch.,FUJIFILM,The X-Pro2 got me back in the game. It’s perfect. Converted after 25 years of Nikon loyalty. However, that means I had to collect new glass. I’ve always shot prime @ 85mm, 35mm and a Wide (20, 24 or, yawn, 28). Gathered those (FUJINON 14, 23 AND 56)...,SECOND BODY. Changing lenses when doing documentary (inc. events like weddings) is laborious, conspicuous, an unwelcome respite and messy. Thus, second body. Which one? The X-Pro2 is my first rangefinder and has a special usefulness. My second needed to be equally effective. I chose the X-T3 (plus battery grip and simple grip - both worth every dime).,It’s now Day Three with the X-T3 and I am in love. It will enable me to produce the work my imagination conjures up. “Why?’, you ask..,It feels like a 4:5 scale F3 (with grip) or a even a classic take on the D700 at 3:4 scale. Tools I know. Tools I love. Tools that don’t make me think about knob fiddling or hunting through designed-by-mathematicians menus.,Except this one has an entire camera shop and darkroom built right in. After a few hours I now have seven custom modes ranging from film noir to oversaturated Velvia to 70s soft portrait. All the Fujifilm cameras have this, yes. Being able to SEE IN BLACK AND WHITE while I’m shooting in black and white doubled what little ‘talent’ I have. No longer do I have to mentally convert and calculate how the film reacts to the world seen through the lens of an SLR. Pause and think about that. My palette is grayscale. Color distracts me.,WHY I LOVE THE X-T3...,Flip out screen.,Touch screen.,Bluetooth remote and transfer.,Fast, fast, fast focusing.,Joystick.,USB-C (thanks Tim Cook),Everything Fujifilm (just the route I took),Software evolution (similar, but not the same firmware as the x-pro2),With battery grip it’s 100% capable of enabling you to apply your Talent (Eye) shooting riots, sports, action, war, protests, more action, more sports. Fast made faster. Ruggedly rugged.  Having a robust camera opens doors and wins trust because subjects recognize you as a professional.,And so much more.,This is the camera that finally allows me to accept digital, forget about digital and shoot unhindered.,Buy it. Buy lots of batteries. The metal grip makes it much easier to hold. The battery grip gets an A.,As a tool, it will be treated as such. I’m curious how it will stand up over time. Picking it up mid-review, I think it’ll be just fine.,Can we slow down on technological evolution? This is enough. I’m good.","March 29, 2019",5.0 out of 5 stars,3MTA3

First thing that really grabbed my attention during the initial test shoot were the dials in top, excellent, quick and easy to use. Next the AF is stellar, very quick and tracks nicely. Finally after the shoot seeing the results of the Extera profile, which more than satisfied my needs. There are so many options I really like about the camera, it seems very well throughout and feels familiar after a few short projects. Bravo to Fujifilm to producing such a great camera!","October 13, 2018",5.0 out of 5 stars,JZ

Right out of the box after turning on the camera and confirming the date, the camera just freezes with black screen, and doesn't even responds to the turn off and on button, i have to physically remove the battery for it to turn off. i researched the problem online and i found a lot of people having the same issue and they called Fuji and they told them it's a fried motherboard!? Very disappointed in Fuji quality control. I was so looking forward to use it and i also bought 2 prime lenses for it, so i had to return everything. I guess after they moved their manufacturing from japan to china the quality went down hill. I didn't want a replacement as this made me feel unsafe with the longevity of this camera, and i just went with the safest route the Sony A7III instead.","May 20, 2019",1.0 out of 5 stars,Lashello

I’m a Nikon girl for the most part but thought this would be a great walk around camera. The Fuji menu systems are a bit more complicated than Nikon but this is my first Fujifilm so there is definitely a learning curve. The photos that this camera produces are gorgeous!

B07H49QWN4,Fujifilm-X-T3-Mirrorless-Digital-Body,Fujifilm X-T3 Mirrorless Digital Camera (Body Only) - Silver,"As a Fujifilm XT20 owner I have become a big fan of the Fuji X system cameras. The XT-3 does not disappoint!  I upgraded to this camera primarily for the  improved focus system,  video capabilities and weatherproofing.  I could not be happier with the performance of the camera. The focusing is so much faster and more accurate and has improved the performance of some of my older Fujinon lenses.  Battery life has never been great in the Fuji system but the XT 3 seems to be a bit better than the XT20- just know you will always need extra batteries on hand with Fuji cameras, but for me that was not a dealbreaker given the trade off  of amazing performance.  After this camera I know I will never go back to DLSR.  Maybe more camera than I needed as a hobbyist/enthusiast but it’s definitely bringing my photography up to the next level-and it is such a fun camera to shoot with  I find myself taking it everywhere.  My favorite combination lens is the 10-24mm f4.0  because I really think this camera excels at landscape photography.  That being said, the 35 mm F2.0 pretty much lives on the body.  The amazing Fuji X lens lineup and this camera body make a perfect kit  that will take your photography game to the next level.","May 29, 2019",5.0 out of 5 stars,TC
B07H49QWN4,Fujifilm-X-T3-Mirrorless-Digital-Body,Fujifilm X-T3 Mirrorless Digital Camera (Body Only) - Silver,"Brilliant, i compared it with Sony a7rii, nikon d7500(though its not mirrorless) . Personally i liked the fuji more. Looks are everyone’s individual choice so I won’t comment. But i liked the retro style. Lens quality is the best i have seen so far in a kit lens. Battery is great but i ordered a spare. I am learning photography but i would say its a bit expensive for amateurs/learners - i absolutely love the viewfinder, as i had seen other competitors’ as well. Got 2 memory card slots, so thats nice. Yet to click and learn settings but whatever i clicked so far was damn good! Waiting for some good weather to go out!! Just a tip : Do not get mixed up in full frame vs crop. If you are tyring to : means u really do not know much about photography. You can get equally amazing shots with a aps c. Try the camera if possible in person and remember a basic dslr can also produce amazing pictures and there is NO bad camera.!!","March 17, 2019",5.0 out of 5 stars,Dushyant 
B07H49QWN4,Fujifilm-X-T3-Mirrorless-Digital-Body,Fujifilm X-T3 Mirrorless Digital Camera (Body Only) - Silver,"Fuji has bested Canon, Nikon, Sony and Panasonic with this camera for its 4K 60fps shooting for starters. Much more intuitive/options for manual knob control and within the menu itself. File sizes are considerably smaller than the Canon 5D Mark IV (1.5 g per minute in 60fps vs canon 4 g in 30fps which is as high as Canon goes per minute to boot). The Fuji is definitely a more well thought out piece of equipment overall. I had even discussed the camera with a B&H specialist whom had just himself purchased the camera for video and also believes the Fuji X-T3 to be the best option on the market. The only 2 downsides I have experienced are slightly less low light capability than the Canon 5D Mark IV or III for that matter and the 4:3 crop factor -neither of which is by any means a deal breaker but it would be nice to see no crop and better low light in their next rendition. One small thing for me is while the LED screen is better than the canon and articulates unlike the canon, it does not flip fully up just tilts and doesn't not flip back which is I like on the screen I have on my old Canon 70D. The screen however is clearer and brighter than the canon 5D and the look of the video is something I like. I will update once I have more experience with the camera but so far, I am very happy. Great job Fuji!","July 28, 2019",5.0 out of 5 stars,Official Best
B07H49QWN4,Fujifilm-X-T3-Mirrorless-Digital-Body,Fujifilm X-T3 Mirrorless Digital Camera (Body Only) - Silver,"I use the camera mostly for video and mainly in commercial applications.  The camera takes awesome 4K video. I don't know of any competitors that offer up to 400MB bit rates like this Fuji does unless you buy a much more expensive commercial video camera.  There are many manual features and it also takes good photos and video in auto mode.  I really like the Chrome profile which gives you film and video a little vintage look.  Very quick auto-focus, nice kit lens f2.8, Solid metal construction.  The only disappoint for some will be the battery life.  Needs a larger battery for all day shooting. I bought the battery grip package so I have plenty of life for a full days shooting.","January 2, 2019",4.0 out of 5 stars,azpc35

B00HNJWUBI,Sony-DSCW830-Digital-Camera-2-7-Inch,Sony DSCW830 20.1 MP Digital Camera with 2.7-Inch LCD (Silver),"This camera was purchased as an inexpensive alternative to a DSLR (ok - not alternative, but when traveling abroad, the teacher wouldn't allow my daughter to bring her DSLR so we got this instead).,This camera caused major distortion on the corners of images - so if any person happened to be in the corner - they looked pretty funny. This camera also had internal dust on the lens. I cleaned the lens several times - with the same stuff I clean my professional lenses with - and nothing got the dust out - so I have to assume it was on the inside of the lens. ALL images had this dust on them - and they are NOT easy to remove in post processing. I had high hopes for this camera being a nice alternative when my daughter can't take her bulky DSLR - but this is not the case. Not many of her photos turned out. Quite disappointing for a once in a lifetime trip.","April 17, 2015",1.0 out of 5 stars,K. Diaz
B00HNJWUBI,Sony-DSCW830-Digital-Camera-2-7-Inch,Sony DSCW830 20.1 MP Digital Camera with 2.7-Inch LCD (Silver),"I bought this camera to take on a trip to China. It was great most of the time. And the 20MP pictures are so much better than my phone. The slow reset to taking the next picture is a little annoying, and I killed the battery every day. I really wish I had gotten a spare battery. So if you will be out for more than 5 hours and you use the zoom a lot and take a lot of pictures, 400 was the most I was able to take in a day, you will really want a spare battery. The auto focus and image stabilization work great, so does the panorama feature. I dropped it a few times and it was still just fine, but maybe I was just lucky.

B07B43WPVK,Sony-Full-Frame-Mirrorless-Interchangeable-Lens-ILCE7M3,"Sony a7 III Full-Frame Mirrorless Interchangeable-Lens Camera Optical with 3-Inch LCD, Black (ILCE7M3/B)","Changed my life.,This is the best camera for anyone who wants to shoot videos and photos, for under $3000.  Get the one with the 28-70mm kit lens, it’ll work just fine. If you want a better lens, get the combo with the Tamron 28-75mm f2.8.,There are better photography cameras out there (A9, A7riii, and Canon consistently wins in photography competitions with the 1DXmkii and 5Dmkiv) but those cameras are expensive. Unless you’re a pro-photographer, the A7iii is more than enough.,Videography is where this camera shines.,The Sony A7iii and a6400 are currently the best cameras for amateur and semi-pro videographers.,Here’s why: at this price point, these are the ONLY cameras that can shoot 1080p 120fps AND have a 4K option (in 24 or 30fps).,In my opinion, these are the only three frame rates that videographers need. 24 and 30 allow you to have the standard cinematic shots (many camera have this option, but the Sony’s have it in non-cropped 4K option).,And you need 120fps, for cinematic slow-motion.  Seriously, for any future videographers out there, you NEED 120p.  60fps is not enough for that beautiful slow-mo that you’ll want.,Only Sony and Nikon (z6) can do it, but Nikon is meh.,Also, Sony has best low light capabilities. No need to say more.,Cons:,The lenses are expensive!!,People say, “glass is more important than the camera body,” but for a videographer, I don’t think so.  If you shoot at 35mm on a 24-70mm vs a 35mm prime lens, you’d have to pixel-peep to tell the difference between the two. What I’m trying to say is, you don’t need that many lenses, regardless of which camera ecosystem you’re with.,For starters, I recommend a mid-range lens (24-70mm f2.8 or f4, or the Tamron 28-75 f2.8) and then grow from there. See which end of that zoom lens do you prefer more. If you’re consistently shooting towards a shorter focal length, then invest in a 16-35mm next. If like me, you find yourself using the high focal length more, get the Sony 85mm 1.8 next.,In the end, I have three lenses only, and they do everything I need.,Sony 16-35 f4,Tamron 28-75 f2.8,Sony 85 f1.8,Conclusion: if you seriously want to dive into videography and photography, to his is the camera for you.","May 26, 2019",5.0 out of 5 stars,Chue Cha
B07B43WPVK,Sony-Full-Frame-Mirrorless-Interchangeable-Lens-ILCE7M3,"Sony a7 III Full-Frame Mirrorless Interchangeable-Lens Camera Optical with 3-Inch LCD, Black (ILCE7M3/B)","I love this camera. My canon 70d broke almost a year ago and I need a new one. I looked a several others and decided full frame mirrorless. It has great autofocus, face and image stabilization(not as good as say a gh5 but still good). I love using my a7III with my sony 90mm 2.8 g lens. I also have a 28-70 sony 3.5-5.6. The kit lens is not that sharp but its pretty great for the price. The sony body itself is small and can barely fit my hands. I use the battery grip to make it more use able and it is fine. The back screen doesn't flip out but it does tilt up. The auto focus for stills is amazing and not bad for video. The menu system is awful but there is not many custom buttons and menus you can avoid this. The image quality is great and I love the 1080p 120fps. The 4k at 24 is great as well. I stay away from the 4k30 since there is a crop. The custom buttons and record are all in great spots. I love the dual card slots. is meant for the faster SD II card but two SD I will work. You can change how you want things to record and too what card. I really love the silent shutter mode which is great for on film set photography, interviews, weddings where you don't want to make a sound. The finally pro is it does work with external monitors like the atoms assassin and small hd. just make sure you get a cage for that. The cons are the lens prices. They are honestly outrageous. The really great sony gm lens are way more expensive then ones for canon and nikon. Almost a 1000 more. The lower end g lens are great but also still pricey. The regular sony lens are what you would except, basic but useable. I would look into sigma lens and other lens companies they do a great job. I am also going to be adapting lens to see what that's like so far I can't give answer. Possibly in an update i could. Another con is the screen is not greatest which is why I use a monitor. The fact that its mirrorless the sensor gets dirty much quicker but I know how to clean my sensor its just something to note. This camera is for hybrid shooters. Its great for stills and video. If you want just video look at a gh5 or black magic. If you want just still this will work but you could get something cheaper. I myself really recommend this camera.","March 9, 2019",4.0 out of 5 stars,Jason G.

Not only does it save files in a complicated tree where your video files are in a different place than your images, but the image files are a continuing sequence, but the video file names reset at every card change.  So, if you buy this to take videos of your kids you will overwrite them and be very upset.  No other major camera manufacturer does this.  I'm coming from a Canon, was using a Fuji FZ80 for a 4k video bridge camera, my wife is a Nikon person (apparently she has more money than me), and I've been using Casio underwater cameras forever.  My old 3.2 megapixel HP camera (that came with a 4x6 printer) didn't have this problem.  Sony came up with this nightmare all on their own.  Wow.  I am still stunned with how stupid this is and if I did not save files in two locations I'd have likely overwritten.,The autofocus is not as good as I would have expected (almost equal to the T4i).  I bought 2 lenses, telescope mount, spare batteries and charger...  And I think this camera is going back.  Since it occasionally just comes out with a completely out of focus mess I can't give autofocus or picture quality 5 stars.","July 30, 2019",1.0 out of 5 stars,John Roberts

That is about where my ""WOW factor"".,Panasonic made a decision to leave items off of this camera items that had a GREAT purpose and now they are gone. Things like the tilt screen,,,the external MIC plug, the macro setting on the setting wheel is gone, and now must be found in the setting menu (it's easy to find, but it used to be easier to just turn the setting wheel). But the tilt screen gone? Why? Having a bridge camera is the reason why folks like me LOVE having a tilt screen. Most of us are amateur photographers, we LIKE the tilt screen! We don't want to manipulate the different lenses,,,many don't like having to mess with manual focus or settings to control many things. I for one like the ability to change my settings manually,,,but,,,I'm also only 5ft tall, I can't get many shots that taller folks can get. But, give me a tilt screen and I can hold the camera up in the air, tilt the screen down, and see what I want for a decent picture,,,that has been taken away.,That being said,,,I could live with it when I saw the zoom ability! I loved it!!! I could see birds hiding in trees from quite a distance! WOW - I was a happy shutter bug! Then I started to use the camera. The zoom focus was sluggish and super slow (it was not supposed to be this way). I played around with the settings, and was hoping that this would change, it didn't. But, I dealt with it, and started taking pictures,,,the back screen was almost invisible in bright sunlight, so I switched to the view finder. Getting my full view was a bit difficult for me, but I got the shots that I wanted. It was a clear, bright sunny day, not a cloud in the sky and spring cherry tree blooms were screaming for their picture to be taken. Out of 128 pictures taken from my walk, over half had to be deleted. This was an anomaly that had never taken place in my photoshop menu before. The ones that I did keep, all had to be manually adjusted for clarity. I was upset. I had such high expectations for this model camera. I was willing to give up certain items, in a swap for that awesome zoom capability, but the quality that was lacking in the photos themselves, was just not worth it. Many people have raved at this model, and the pictures that it takes. Perhaps I just got a bad camera? I don't know. I cannot be sure. And, I'm not willing to take that chance. I will be waiting for a different brand camera, to arrive on the market place in March. It will cost much more, but, at this point, I'd rather spend more money, and get everything that I want in a camera.","February 25, 2014",3.0 out of 5 stars,CMac -Amazon Addict!

While I've only had a couple of cheaper cameras that I could call my own, I have used a variety of cameras, but this is my first DSLR....and I LOVE IT! The Canon lens that comes with it is a handy for multiple situations and shooting conditions, as well as the ability to zoom a bit. However, my praises on this bundle, for the most part, start and end with the camera and the Canon lens. Most of the bundle is kind of a joke except for a few choice items, that I should say does still make it worth the additional $20 or so more it is than getting just the camera and lens without the accessories. The bag, SD cards, and SD card reader are all helpful, and are by themselves worth the extra $20 for the included accessory bundle. However, the stand alone flash is not compatible with this camera. The two ""lenses"" that are included are not really lenses at all, but actually screw on the end of your nice Canon lenses, making your pictures worse. The cheap filters are exactly that, a handful of cheap filters, that I suppose could come in handy, maybe, one day...possibly. I have not tried out the remote switch yet or the lens cleaning kit. And lastly, the tripod is a cheap plastic one that will likely get broken in a matter of a few shows during transport, and will likely need to be replaced. Attached some photos from the camera.,Tl;dr - This bundle is great, and this camera is amazing for someone who wants solid quality for a good price. The accessories that come with it are worth the extra $20.","January 9, 2018",5.0 out of 5 stars,Tyler L.

It is absolutely amazing with the ETERNA film simulation. But if you color grade your footage, it is even BETTER. For photo, Fujifilm is famous for their color science. X-T3 provides a number film simulations for JPG color rendering. They are all very good.

However, when I do video, I always use a gimbal anyway. So it is not a big deal for me. Finally, I have to say, the X-T3 is the best camera that I have ever bought and I absolutely love it.

PLUS there are a ton of other upgrades.  I don't use it for video now, but maybe in the future.  I use it with two primes (16mm + 56mm) that are the crown jewels in the Fuji lens line.  I bought it with the battery grip and the combination of the two are soooo much smaller than my old Nikon rig.

B07H49QWN4,Fujifilm-X-T3-Mirrorless-Digital-Body,Fujifilm X-T3 Mirrorless Digital Camera (Body Only) - Silver,"Love this camera and everything it does. No issues. Only complaint I have with this camera is low light capability. I came to Fuji from a Nikon D750 and haven’t looked back, even with the z series. Fujis lenses are just too sharp and good to worry about z series being built up slowly. Also way cheaper with arguable better quality glass. My D750 was incredible at low light. This is The best crop sensor camera at low light but not quite as good as my former ff body. Yet here is the cool thing about Fuji, the low light noise isn’t really noise but grain. I haven’t noticed it looking blotchy or discolored light Sony stuff. All that happens is a film like grain. You could just call it character!","December 25, 2018",5.0 out of 5 stars,Kyle
B07H49QWN4,Fujifilm-X-T3-Mirrorless-Digital-Body,Fujifilm X-T3 Mirrorless Digital Camera (Body Only) - Silver,"I switched from a Nikon D750 into the X-T3. Whoah. I was not prepared to be as impressed by the X-T3 as I was. It is truly a special camera. It has almost any feature you could ask for in a camera today. It is definitely on par with the Sony A7III and any other high-end mirrorless camera. The only difference being its APS-C sensor size instead of full-frame. Ultimately, that was the game breaker for me because of my shooting style, wanting as much bokeh as I can get regardless of lens.,Speaking of lenses, I used the Fujinon 35mm f/1.4 and the 16-55 f/2.8. Both lenses were phenomenal and matched the superior build quality of the X-T3.,The auto-focusing on this camera is INSANE. It has Eye-Detect/Tracking AF and almost never misses. I can't tell you how satisfying it is to nail focus on the eye instead of the eye-lashes or nose. However, it is lacking eye-detection on animals, which is something Sony, Panasonic, Canon, and maybe even Nikon mirrorless systems all offer. I am sure there will be a firmware update to support this eventually. But, it would seriously make this the best AF system available if you could track your dog or cat as well. (niche, but still prevalent in today's Prosumer market).,As far as build goes, you can't beat it. It feels so durable and without any expenses paid. The combination between metal, yes metal (not plastic), all around and the faux-leather grip is truly stunning. The dials are fun and such, but I literally never used them. I set my camera up to use normal function buttons and dials that all cameras have.,Speaking of function buttons: this camera has about 9 different buttons you can program to do any of about 50 functions. Additionally, you can program 4 actions on the touch screen as well, bringing the total up to 13 different quick function controls. In reality, you actually can get 17 different controllable functions if you use the dedicated shutter, iso, exposure compensation dials as well as the aperture ring on all fuji lenses. I have never experienced a camera that allows for so many micro adjustments to be made manually without having to do a certain combination of buttons.,Being a mirrorless APS-C camera, it is very small. Too small for me. I had to buy a grip to add to it, just to comfortably hold onto it, especially with that rather large 16-55 lens. But, I have decently large hands and was coming off of the Nikon D750 which has an enormous grip on it. The pro for its size is its ability to travel very easily as well as walk around all day holding onto it.,I will also add that this camera produces amazing, moody colors, has incredible video capabilities, and is one of the best cameras I have ever used. Sadly, Fuji has no intention of making a full-frame camera, so I have switched back to the Nikon family.,Who is this camera for:,-Moody/punchy wedding photographers or videographers that don't mind having less bokeh.,-Street photographers,-Anyone who grew up using vintage style cameras and want some nostalgia in their lives,-Anyone looking to use photography as a career.,-Anyone looking to switch to mirrorless, but not spend $2000+ just for a body and then fork over thousands for lenses.,-Vloggers who don't mind an external monitor","August 2, 2019",5.0 out of 5 stars,Jen Tenut

I've been brand loyal to Sony, since my first child was born, and we've used Sony Cybershot since 2006. When they broke in the past, it was my fault (dropping it etc), but this is my 4th time buying one, and the quality has taken a nosedive. It is not worth the name anymore, and now I don't trust the SONY name either.  This camera is flimsy, so the battery is hard to get in and out, but once it's in, it can easily fall out. But worse than the battery issue is the fact that it takes a long time to focus/take the shot, and then a really long time to take a repeated shot, even without the flash. You can't effectively take photos of children, which is mission critical for me.  The other Cybershots, even back in 2006 were not this slow!

It isn't that I couldn't fiddle with the settings, or that I don't at times, but I enjoy just setting it to Intelligent Auto and letting the camera do all the work.  The problem I've found is that at times this camera just takes blurry pictures due to it not switching to a good setting.  It also tends to take a lot of dark images.  At times you think you've taken a good shot and get it back on the computer and realize that it is in fact blurry.

It was ground breaking at the time to have a camera of that size, that much zoom, and at that price point.  I feel the same way about this Lumix.  The 60x lens is an incredible amount of magnification that is usable, hand held, in good light, the image stabilization is that good.  It may be the largest super zoom camera I've owned, but I don't mind carrying it, given it's ability to take long distance shots of small objects, with nothing more than a steady hand (in good light).,2018 Update- continues to amaze.

Why would you trade it in and order this instead? Well, a minor detail is that this is 60x zoom so I gain a bit on the wide angle end but, again that is minor. I had a Lumix travel camera before (for serious stuff my ""big boy"" cameras are Olympus and Lumix mirrorless interchangeable lens models) and I used that camera until I wore the paint off the controls. When it came time to replace it, the Canon was being closed out and was a super deal. Now this one is at a great price and the major thing that drove the purchase is realizing how much I missed the viewfinder which this has and the Canon does not. Only a biggie when taking pix outside in the bright sun and this being Florida...","August 7, 2016",4.0 out of 5 stars,Fred Forbes

Stabilization, Touch Enabled 3-Inch LCD, Wi-Fi, DC-FZ80K (Black)","I purchased this F70 for myself for Christmas after exhaustively researching all the ""super zoom"" cameras I could find, including all of the reviews on this site. If you're considering this camera, know that you probably won't find it in any but the largest camera stores and the online price varies widely. Last week on Amazon it varied from $249.00-349.00, and that's on the one site! Needless to say, I waited until it was $249. I’m not a professional photographer so this isn’t a technical review, but I’ve been taking pictures for about 50 years, first with Kodak roll film box cameras, then a twin lens reflex, then a series of manual 35mm cameras (no light meter), and culminating in my ultimate 35mm, a Nikon FM. I’ve used various digital cameras that my wife owned, including a Minolta and a Canon ELPH. Until I bought my wife a Canon SX50 last xmas, I was not ready to give up my Nikon but the Canon astounded me with its picture quality, small size, light weight, and of course that 50X optical zoom (effectively 24-1200mm). After selling my Nikon, I was about set to buy another SX50 for myself when I saw the Panasonic FZ70. What attracted me was the 20mm wide angle and 60X optical zoom as well as the manual control options. I was turned off by some of the reviews regarding picture quality especially compared to the SX50 but after re-reading the reviews, I decided to take a chance and ordered it and I’m glad I did. I set it on a tripod and photographed a tree about a half mile away, first at wide angle then at 60X zoom and another at 50X zoom. And I did the same thing with her Canon. Despite tripod shake and a strong wind blowing the tree, the FZ70 took a remarkably clear shot at 60X. At 50X it actually appeared to have more detail than the Canon when viewed on my computer. I liked the colors with the Canon better but the colors are adjustable on the Panasonic so I could probably duplicate the results. I wish there was a way to upload the photos so I could show you.  Also, the 20mm on the Panasonic is a real advantage for me because I shoot mostly landscapes and the panoramic feature works as advertised, enabling you to take up to a 360 degree shot in one pass! Close-ups are also astounding, without even enabling a macro feature. As mentioned by another reviewer, the on/off switch does seem flimsy but at least you won’t turn it on or off accidentally. It’s also bigger and bulkier and hard to find a case for – I ended up ordering a Tamrac 5210 from Cameta Camera on Ebay which should fit. If you buy this camera and use a UV filter at all times as I do to protect the lens, follow one reviewer’s recommendation and get a quality multi-coated glass filter like the Sigma, because cheap filters can affect the clarity. I bought a set of Vivitar filters for my wife’s Canon from Digital Goya through Amazon and they seem fine but I opted for the more expensive Sigma for my Panasonic. To summarize, don’t believe everything you read. Different cameras perform differently under different conditions with different settings. Decide what’s important  to you and try several if you can. I’d be perfectly happy with another Canon SX50; it’s a great camera, but I’m glad I took a leap of faith and bought the Panasonic. No more film, no more lens changing, and I sold my Nikon and a Samsung camcorder which more than paid for the Panasonic – I’m a happy camper. If you’re a professional, neither will probably replace your SLR or DSLR or camcorder, but for the rest of us, these open a whole new world of photography.","December 28, 2013",5.0 out of 5 stars,Bill Benjamin

And if you like shooting birds and other outdoor distance things, you will love this camera.  Should be illegal with the zoom on this camera.  Stabilizer works great for optical distance, but IQ suffers when you extend the zoom.  And it really extends.  Try changing the size of the mps and it will go to super extreme tele distanc es.

B07GPRSYG8,Nikon-Full-Frame-Mirrorless-Camera,Nikon Z6 Full Frame Mirrorless Camera Body,"I'm a long-time Nikon user, going back to film camera days. I've eagerly awaited Nikon's first full-frame mirrorless cameras, and the new Z6 exceeds my expectations.,First, this is truly a Nikon. Build quality if outstanding, and the look and feel is 100% Nikon. If you've used a Nikon DSLR, you'l be right at home here. First and foremost, picture quality is just outstanding. Detailed images, with natural colors, especially skin tones. I've always thought Nikon's colors were a standout, and the Z6 continues in this tradition.,There's tons of options for shooting different effects, and the Z6 expands to include many additional filter effects I've not seen on prior high-end DSLRs (you can find these under the ""Set Picture Control"" option, most easily reached by pressing the ""i"" button on the back. The touch-screen is a great feature here, it makes navigation from the ""i"" button quite natural and easy. I didn't notice any banding or moire effects in various outdoor shots at smaller apertures (shooting both the 24-70 Z lens and a number of my older AF-S lense via the excellent FTZ adapter). Hi-ISO performance is stunning. Even at 12,600, there's amazingly little noise in the Z6 images. In sum, the Z6 produces excellent images in either Raw or out-of-camera JPEGs.,Highlights with the Z6 controls and usage are the huge, bright no-lag electronic viewfinder. This is a joy to use! Even in very-dark scenes, the viewfinder shows a bright, clear image, almost like night vision for very dark night scenes. There is truly no discernable lag here, either.,Nikon *finally* added U1-U2-U3 settings to the program dial, a much better system than the ""shooting banks"" from prior high-end offerings. This allows you to setup 3 different camera states (I use ""landscape"", ""portrait"", and ""action"") and recall each with a simple turn of the dial. So much easier than the old method.,Many early reviews (especially of the Z7) raised some issues with autofocus, especially in tracking modes of faster-moving subjects. I've just not had issues in this area in a few days of usage of the Z6. The single point modes are great, and cover nearly the entire image area. There's a ""nub"" controller on the back, perfectly placed under my right thumb, that allows you to move this point easily over your subject. The Z6 was tack-sharp in nearly every photo using this method, especially with the native 24-70 Z lens. The auto modes worked well, too. It's not quite as quick to pickup less-contrasty subject in AF-C modes compared to my D500, but it's pretty close. There is 3D subject-tracking mode under ""auto"". Press the center OK button, and a white box appears. Move this over your subject (by either re-framing or the nub control), and half-press the shutter. The Z6 will now track this subject throughout the frame. Give a full shutter press when you want to take the shot. The framing box will continue to track the subject, so you can keep taking shots as you like. Work's great. The Z6 uses a combination of shape and color info to recognize the subject, and follows it throughout the frame. To reset the box, you have to hit ""ok"" again, and you can start again. Easier to use than describe here, actually.,There's just so much more to say about the Z6. I haven't dived into video modes, but all the other reviews say this is an extremely capable video camera. In-body vibration reduction (called IBIS - in body image stabilization) is another game changer on older lenses that lack this feature. Focus peaking (courtesy of the electronic view finder) means use of older, manual focus lenses is quite easy! Between IBIS and focus peaking, those older Nikon telephotos are starting to look like a real bargain.,Mirrorless really is a game changer, and Nikon's first full-frame versions are an outstanding advance. So many features here: in-body stabilization, autofocus covering nearly the entire frame, an outstanding, high-res and no-lag viewfinder, tons of picture and shooting options, it all adds up to a highly recommended camera in a great, compact form.,I'm not selling my D810 or D500 just yet, but the Z6 has become my go-to camera for most usage (I'm still shooting wildlife on the D500). Well done, Nikon!","November 22, 2018",5.0 out of 5 stars,J. C. M.
B07GPRSYG8,Nikon-Full-Frame-Mirrorless-Camera,Nikon Z6 Full Frame Mirrorless Camera Body,"I shoot the northern lights weekly and sometimes nightly for 8 months a year. I purchased this after reading reviews and seeing test images at high ISO level with the expectation that the noise / grainly levels would be better by about 1 stop over the Nikon D610 which I'm coming from. From my experience, this is true and the image quality is fantastic. This is a great camera for low light, astro/ northern lights work based on the output. The low light video is sensitive enough to film the northern lights in real time and the digital viewfinder helps you set the correct exposure the first time when the lights are bright. When they are very dim the view finger doesn't seem to pick them up at all.,Here are some of the negatives that I expected going in and I have taken no stars off for:,-Less than stellar battery life,-XQD card slot (I had to pay 120 dollars for my card, my sd cards are 20-30 dollars normally),-needs an adapter for f mount lens,-3rd party batteries don't work (yet perhaps some will be engineered in the future),Here are the problems that I have had that I did not expect starting with the most annoying and it really distracts from the user experience massively:,- Every time I put it on a 2-second timer delay and the camera times out to sleep mode it wakes up out of it, and every time I shut off the camera in 2-second timer delay mode it turns on out of it! Mind you I exclusively shoot on a tripod on a 2-second timer delay for night shots to give the camera/tripod 2 seconds to settle down after touching it and have no handshake. Every time I have to hit the button and reset it and this is a pain at -20  to -40f in Fairbanks, Alaska in the winter when I don't want my fingers to freeze! My Nikon D610 has a dial for timer delay on the top left and never changes unless I tell it to! This alone is worth minus 2 stars for me, I am considering returning the camera or selling it over this issue. I guess I could get a remote shutter release instead... but this brings me to the next issue.,(If somehow there is a way to have the timer delay stay permanently activated let me know in the comments and I'll add back on 1-2 stars despite the other issues) If this is not the case, Nikon do a firmware update and fix this, for God's sake!,-My 3rd party speed flash won't work on it, it feels like Nikon specifically engineered its new camera to not allow the user to use 3rd party accessories and force you to buy a several hundred dollar flash over my perfectly fine 30 dollar fash. Does this mean if I buy a 3rd party remote shutter release it also won't work to solve the lack of a permanent 2-second timer delay mode? My workaround has been to hand hold the flash (so I don't cause camera shake when triggering it) and manually trigger it. This is not ideal and freezes my fingers further in the sub-arctic of Alaska. I use the flash for aurora portraits.,-Every time the camera goes to sleep or is shut off the aperture rings stop down to the smallest aperture. I shoot wide open or almost wide open on all my shots so when I turn it back on the aperture blades open up again, will this cause excessive wear and tear on the aperture blades and motor and break my lenses? I do not know but it worries me. I wish the blades stayed in sleep mode exactly where they were when it went to sleep / was shut off at.,-Lightroom will not detect any of my lenses for the lens profile correction (I am only using the adapter). This includes sigma, rokinon, and tamron. I have not tested to see if Lightroom will detect my lenses shot on a Nikon brand lens through the adapter yet. This isn't that big of a deal but all the annoying things add up to a frustrating user experience.,-For extreme low light situations, the digital viewfinder is a negative. You can use the optical one on the Nikon D610 to compose a shot with almost zero light by using subtle silhouettes and shadows but with the Z6 you get all black if its dark enough. This means you have to take a few test shots and adjust your camera to the right composition based on them, this further chews up the already weak battery performance and takes up more time which causes fingers to freeze more in the cold.","December 14, 2018",3.0 out of 5 stars,Aaron
B07GPRSYG8,Nikon-Full-Frame-Mirrorless-Camera,Nikon Z6 Full Frame Mirrorless Camera Body,"These are my first impressions with the Nikon Z6.  I will update this review as I learn more:,I loved shooting the Fuji X100 series for it's light weight and simple UI.  But The ultimate shooting experience has always been with my Nikons.  When we got focus peaking and meaningful fps with the D850 I was happy, sold the X100T, and have been happily gripping my D850 wherever I go with the lightweight 35mm 1.8 and a 70-200 f4.  I toss in the 20mm 1.8G and 300mm PF when I travel and keep the 60mm and 105mm macros handy, as needed.  Been shooting Nikon since the D1, then D70, D200, D600, and now the current generation (as of Nov 2018).,(I will need to test the new diffraction compensation mode (leaving off for now), and how this might interact with the AA filter, vs the D850),Onto the camera:,The Z6 takes great pictures.  I attached two ISO 25600 (insane!) pics to this review, edited in camera to jpeg normal.  Pics of the kids look even better and I'm looking forward to attaching this to my telescope and 20mm for nightscapes.  Nikon image quality.  2 Thumbs, all the way up.,Handling: Left hand is fine.  Play and delete buttons are top back left.  Mode dial requires a push of the center button to turn.  Nothing to see here, folks.  It's fine.,Right hand: It's OK.  New layout, which is ok.  AF-On and joystick nub are where they should be.  As is D-pad - as accustomed as I am  to the DSLRs I found these three important controls well placed. The challenge was with the 4 lowest buttons.  As it is now, I find myself looking at those (menu, shooting mode, + and -).  If I wasn't programmed for my DSLRs I am sure this wouldn't be an issue - there is no perfect layout for everyone and the camera makers do their best.  It's different from my D850, as it should be.  I'd have tried to do things a little differently but Nikon didn't ask me.  :)  Otherwise, I like the grip.  I wear small or medium size adult male gloves, and my hand fits perfectly over the grip and finding the AF-On button with my thumb is comfortable.,I usually utilize the depth of preview button on my DSLRs.  Doing so here seems pointless/useless so I will make that button do something else.  For now I have it set to change focusing modes, as it is quicker than using the i menu.  Second front button is set to ""My Menu"" which works for me.,Ergonomics: I usually use a Fusion Photo Gear plate with a Herringbone Hand Grip and Black Rapid sling straps.  The plates and hand grip don' fit or feel right, which has sent me on a wild goose chase. For now I have a plate on that is compatible.  Will update this once I find a proper solution.  The problem is the FTZ adapter gets in the way of all the various plates I have in inventory.  Something functional will come along, but in the meantime I am hacking things together.  Since it's so light, I added a leather wrist strap to the grip side for when the strap isn't needed but I want to keep the camera secure to my body.,Usage: I'll use the FTZ but I won't like it.  It works. But it feels weird and adds odd length.  My 70-200 f4 chirps and creaks something odd while in continuous AF mode, hunting within a certain zone.  75% seem to be in focus, at ISO 21500.  The 70-300 AF-P seems to move similarly, albeit much more quietly.  Same hit rate.  But it was dark when  I tested.,Will keep an eye on this because the d850 nails these lenses in the dark.  Will have to test with some nightscapes and parties.,Menus are familiar.  If anyone knows how to make the ISO move in 1 stop increments, please lmk.  I either keep glossing over it, or it isn't there.  :/,The usable AF points over the whole frame: genius.  Finally.  Well done, Nikon.,Weight and Carrying: Love the light weight of the Z6 with the 35mm S lens.  This is why I could leave the Fuji X100 - the kit is larger but not obnoxious and the lens and image quality will keep me coming back for more.  For travel, I'm happy with this combo.  With the 70-200or300, even more so.  Will be nice to have native lenses at some point, though.,4 stars until the lenses come, and we all learn more about the Autofocus system.  I appreciate what the FTZ adapter is supposed to accomplish but I just don't like it in af-c with the 70-200 f4.  I had big hopes here, and maybe I have to better understand the focus system.  Hopefully this gets sorted out via firmware updates, if not in a re-education of how to use the AF system.  Chasing kids, pets, birds, and such is so easy with the 3D tracking on DSLRs that it became my default AF mode.  Yes, I am spoiled, but it really is that fast and useful.  That said, there's nothing really wrong with the Z6 autofocus system.  I believe it works as it was designed, and we can auto-track just as the manual describes.  It's the extra step it takes to get there.  If 4.5 stars were an option, then that's what I would rate it.","November 23, 2018",4.0 out of 5 stars,undfined
B07GPRSYG8,Nikon-Full-Frame-Mirrorless-Camera,Nikon Z6 Full Frame Mirrorless Camera Body,"I was hoping for this to weigh less than a typical SLR. I have a Nikon D300s and needed something that shot the same quality but lighter. Sadly, this wasn’t it. It isn’t worth the money to have something pretty much the same weight but negligible in terms of quality of phots, for what I do with them at the least. I’m going to wait till technology gets better and these things go lighter.","December 22, 2018",2.0 out of 5 stars,Franwin Pharmacy Mineola Surgical
B07GPRSYG8,Nikon-Full-Frame-Mirrorless-Camera,Nikon Z6 Full Frame Mirrorless Camera Body,"Autofocus is terrible.,Reviewing images I can see the red box was placed on the subject and still it recorded the image out of focus. I went to a Nikon event and had the Nikon representative check the settings and aimed it at him. Most of the images were still out of focus. After a few tries he told me that their photographers do not use face detection and just shoot single point. We tried that and it was better, but at 1 to 1, the focus was still off. If you have a patient subject you can get your shot. The idea of upgrading is to get something better than what you had. Lets be honest, any experienced photographer has a pretty good idea how the image will look with a light meter. EVF will not dramatically change your results. Having a good autofocus will dramatically change you results. Equate it to a Ferrari with bald and brittle tires. If your careful and go slow you can keep it on the road. You could have kept a Ford Pinto on the road and also bought a house to drive home to. I admit the Ferrari is beautiful and that is what you get here.,Colors and noise are rendered beautifully, but that was also the case with the D750. If you think a splash of water will not kill a D750, you are mistaken. If this camera has the same sealing it means lens release button has no gasket so...,I was truly disappointed. I wanted to love this camera, maybe that is why I was so disappointed when it would not let me.","January 12, 2019",2.0 out of 5 stars,ioji

B07GPRSYG8,Nikon-Full-Frame-Mirrorless-Camera,Nikon Z6 Full Frame Mirrorless Camera Body,"I'm a beginner photography enthusiast, and was wanting to get my first full frame camera, and boy, I feel like I hit the market at both a great time, but almost overwhelming time with the choices. A few months earlier and my only FF mirrorless choice would have been the Sony, but with the Nikon out, I researched the two extensively. I've seen a lot of of the photography community recommending Sony, but for my purposes, I thought the Nikon was a better fit, and in the past month of using it, I've never regretted going with the Z6. Regarding the camera's auto-focus performance, I've never had issue, but from what I understand, the criticism has centered around fast moving subjects such as wildlife or sports photography, which isn't my game. I am exploring astro, landscape, and street photography, plus just getting some great shots of the family, and it's been on point. Regarding battery life, I'm generally shooting for maybe 2-3 hours at a time and been fine, but did run out of juice on Thanksgiving when I was using it all day and had to take a break to charge it, so I'll prob get an extra battery at some point (baby steps).,Ultimately, I chose this over the A7iii as it seemed like it would be easier to learn for someone newer, and overall, it checked all the right boxes in terms of ease of use, viewfinder, durability/weather-proofing, ergonomics, and picture quality, and I've been enjoying getting myself out of auto mode and exploring the artistic opportunities this camera affords me. I would like to see eye auto-focus come down the road as its available in the A7's and EOSR, but aside from that, I think it's just an awesome tool that you can't go wrong with. Btw, I give two shits about dual slots, but I'm just a hobbyist and not shooting weddings or anything, so is a non-issue for me, but totally get that criticism in its reviews by pros.","December 20, 2018",5.0 out of 5 stars,Tony R

( D850, D500, D750)  I actually really love this camera . I bought it for video and I have found myself shooting it for everything. No it does not track like the d500 ! However I have found that single shot focus is the very best mode for even a flying bird. I know that is  not the preferred method but it actually works . Being a long time DSLR shooter I was surprised at how much I have enjoyed the EVF . The images are tack sharp and the ISO performance is outstanding. The Video, well its phenomenal!!

B07GPRSYG8,Nikon-Full-Frame-Mirrorless-Camera,Nikon Z6 Full Frame Mirrorless Camera Body,"For the past 10 years I've been shooting Leica M cameras.  Currently I use an M10.  I also have a Leica CL camera for backup.  Neither camera nor Leica lenses are weather resistant.  For this reason I wanted a camera that I was not afraid to get some rain or snow on.  Hence, the reason for buying the Z6 along with the 35mm Z lens.,Had I not been shooting Leica cameras and lenses (as well as Zeiss lenses) the past 10 year, I would have rated the Nikon Z6 5-star rather than 4-star.  The Z6 camera is a very good camera.  The menu options are not too arcane that I was not able to figure out most of the settings I wanted without having to extensively consult the manual (I did look a few things up but they were easy to find in the manual).,The Nikon 35mm Z lens is good but frankly for the price ($850-ish) the image quality is only average.  Again, if I did not have Leica or Zeiss as a comparison, I would probably have rated this lens 5-star but overall, the Z6 and Z lens are very good but not great.  Great would warrant 5-star but very good is 4-star.,I have not had any of the problems with auto focus that many internet experts report.  For stills and the occasional video clip, the images are fine and the auto focus has performed very well.  I have been impressed by the image color… nicely saturated (better than Leica), decent contrast (not nearly as good as Leica) and decent small detail (again, not as good as Leica).,A lot is made of dynamic range.  I am not a mega pixel examiner and so I find the recent obsession with dynamic range a little over the top.  As long as my main subject is in focus, has good color, sharp detail, I really don't care how many leaves on the bush in the distance I can make out or how much detail in the foreground can be recovered.,So, for still shooting and occasional video recording, the Z6 and 35mm Z lens are highly adequate and will make all but the most discerning shooter very happy.","January 4, 2019",4.0 out of 5 stars,G.

I put a 128g memory card in mine, reads it fine. The only down side I've seen (not to bad) is the time it takes for the picture to take after you hit the button.

B00HNJWUBI,Sony-DSCW830-Digital-Camera-2-7-Inch,Sony DSCW830 20.1 MP Digital Camera with 2.7-Inch LCD (Silver),"Love this camera. Used it all day 4th of July and then took it on a 10-day vacation and, after charging it initially, I only had to charge it one time. Got the SanDisk 32GB card to go with it & took at least 200 photos and all turned out perfectly.  Very easy to use - can snap pictures with one hand and they are easy to download to my computer.","July 17, 2018",5.0 out of 5 stars,M Chandler

People, we are reviewing the camera not the battery...!!!!  Battery charges on Amazon are 10-12...buy one. :),Anyhow, onto my impressions.  I have an a7r2 which is a great camera as well.  From my perspective I am basically comparing the a73 to the a7r2.,The a73 battery life is awesome for a mirrorless body, it can shoot 700+ jpg images without a charge.  I used to have to carry 5-7 batteries fully charged with my a7r2, but not anymore!,Focus Speed and EYE-AF is snappy and accurate.  I took some test shots indoor at ISO 6400 to 12k with a moving 10 year old and 90% of my shots were in focus.  TOTAL game changer for me with shooting in poorly lit areas and still having sharp image.  I would have never been able to get 90% of my images in focus in a poorly lit room with my a7r2.,ISO perfomance, just lookup some examples on DP Review and other sites.  The ISO literally shocked me when I was reviewing my RAW images in lightroom.  You can shoot at 12k ISO without issues and for casual shots 25k is also usable.  This kicks the a7r2's &^$ in low light and I would even say it is better in low light than the a7s2, images are sharper and color is not muddied on a73 when compared to a7s2 or a7r2.,Color on the new Sony's is also much better and the images produced with the camera are SO sharp and vibrant, that sensor is MAGIC!,No camera is perfect...here are few issue I have that I wish were better.,Menu system is still very confusing but better than a72.,Resolution of the EVF and screen are not as high as I would like.,Screen does not flip out or rotate for video users (I don's shoot video) but still an issue for some.  I have not tested but some people have stated that the camera overheats in some cases when shooting for a prolonged period.,For under 2k this camera delivers on every level.  I have enjoyed it and look forward to getting some amazing images.","April 13, 2018",5.0 out of 5 stars,Manuel L.

Stabilization, Touch Enabled 3-Inch LCD, Wi-Fi, DC-FZ80K (Black)","Great features of this camera: 1) the 60X zoom, of course; 2)  one can quickly switch between taking pictures and recording videos by pushing a button; 3) there is very little time between pushing the button and the picture being taken; 4) lots of fun picture effects and pre-set scenes - in fact, probably more than I will ever need; 5) the automated i-mode can produce good pictures in a wide range of settings, and allows for some customization of the shot if desired; 6) the macro feature can get you very close to the subject; 7) the camera can take pictures in RAW mode; 8) it can take panoramic pictures.,Not-so-great features: 1)The display is fixed instead of being able to swivel to different angles, which may make it hard to take pictures holding the camera above the head or of objects on the ground. 2) It takes a while to save the pictures, so if you are taking (with the zoom, of course) a series of pictures of your graduating kid you better stop before the kid gets too close to whomever is handing out the diplomas (thank goodness for school photographers). 3) Sometimes when there are strong variations in illumination in a picture the results can be quite bizarre, such as completely white faces on some people while others close to them look normal. I suspect that using the RAW format would prevent this, but I usually stay in the auto modes.,I am also wondering why all cameras I have used, this one included, seem to have the battery compartment next to the tripod attachment, so that if the battery runs out while the camera is mounted on a tripod one must remove the camera from the tripod to swap batteries.,My previous camera was a Sony Cybershot, which seemed to produce clearer, more detailed pictures. I don't know if this is due to the fact that the Cybershot had great quality optics or to the fact that I am still learning how to best use the LUMIX. I suspect that the LUMIX optics may not be the best, but they are certainly functional. So far, after a couple of months of ownership, I am quite excited about this camera - it is very versatile with a great selection of fun possibilities, such as the ""miniature"" mode. I have been able to take decent pictures of anything from the moon to bugs to family members. The zoom performs best with a tripod, like all zooms, especially when fully deployed, but the software does a good job compensating for instability when the camera is hand-held. There are better cameras on the market, but this one is a good value for the price, at least in my opinion.","May 15, 2015",4.0 out of 5 stars,Jane

I just wanted something that would take nice photographs from far away, action shots, and general photo taking.  This camera does all of that very easily.,I got tired of going to my kids' school functions with just a 4x zoom camera (or my cell phone) only to get THE WORST PICTURES POSSIBLE!  My oldest son had this graduation ceremony from fifth grade.  I was 200ft away.  They were too far away and the picutres I took closer were so blurry they were unusable.,With this camera, those days are over!  You can zoom in from so far away it's ridiculous!  The nice thing is that they don't seem to lose too much picture quality, either.  The picture quality is fantastic!  I will say this; if you zoom all the way out (or close to it) it gets a little shaky.  You can still take the shot but you might want to use a tripod or brace it on something.,Other than that, pictures come out vibrant and crystal clear, even with kids running at full steam.,I am very happy with this product.

Large aperture which allows allows hand held shots at full zoom and use of filters that reduce one stop or more.

Love this camera!  My old Lumix bit the dust after a LOT of use and so I upgraded to this newer model.  It's fabulous.  Has the point and shoot (intelligent auto) feature along with some manual capabilities...great for the hobbyist that isn't a professional photographer that knows all the technical aspects of shooting photos.  I like the creative options on this one as well.  I took a handheld close up of the moon (slight shake so it wasn't a clear as if I'd used a tripod) with the super zoom on this camera and was able to see craters in pretty good detail...kids thought that was pretty cool!  My photos have been consistently bright, clear and focused and the video is great too.  I would highly recommend this camera to someone who needs a reliable, quality camera to take photos of their kids, vacation, everyday things...can't speak to the professional capabilities.  :)","January 10, 2015",5.0 out of 5 stars,SLP-mom

I knew that we wouldn't be able to get real close to the animals & some of the scenery. I had my professional photographer, (daughter), look at the reviews & specs. She said that it would be a good entry level camera. All I'm going to say is that she had my new camera in her hands 80% of the time. The words I heard the most was ""I hate this cheap, lite weight camera!!"" I think it had something to do with the cost of her cameras & lenses that was in her expensive case for most of the trip.,The biggest down fall that I read about this was the fuzzy pictures. I'm not sure why that happened because there was some amazing photos taken out the side widow at 80 MPH, even zoomed all the way out. Just remember to roll down the window, you get less reflections.,So my unprofessional oppion is buy this lite weight, cheap, entry level, camera if you need to get great long range & close pictures.,  Over 2,000 pictures, 1 drop of 4ft. on cement, battery held up great, just charge every night. Get a large memory card it helps.","July 6, 2016",5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazon Customer

B078YR3MNK,AbergBest-Rechargeable-Digital-Students-cameras,"AbergBest 21 Mega Pixels 2.7"" LCD Rechargeable HD Digital Camera,Video camera Digital Students cameras,Indoor Outdoor for Adult/Seniors/Kids (Black)","I bought this as a replacement for  Canon I'd bought my wife a few years ago that just quit working after hardly any use at all. I have an old Canon Powershot that has taken a beating and kept ticking, but the newer models don't seem to be as tough and aren't repairable at all. The firmware on this  camera is surprisingly decent. It has locked up on me once and simply removing the battery to reboot fixed that. The included spare battery is a very nice and useful surprise. Charging is fairly quick and when the camera is charged the red LED shuts off. Battery longevity is good to excellent. Setup is, luckily, pretty intuitive, because the manual is laughable and about as helpful as a plague-infected Deer Tick.,It's not obvious from either the camera or the manual, but there is a cool lens change switch feature  just above the USB port that allows you to shift the camera from distance focus to close and it works very well. The camera's software, however, far exceeds the camera's lens quality and that is the consistent limiting factor in picture quality. It would be unreasonable to expect a high quality lens in a $35 camera, so don't. However, because of the ease of use, battery life, well-designed features, size, and convenience, I find myself grabbing this camera instead of my Powershot 2 out of 3 times I decide to take a picture. If we lose it or break it, it won't be a big financial loss and I'd probably buy another.","July 22, 2019",4.0 out of 5 stars,GeezerCaveman

Cheap enough they could break it within a year and you won't even be mad (and definitely cheaper than letting them use your phone camera), simple enough that they won't be overwhelmed, but still handling mostly like a typical digital camera so if/when they step-up to something a bit more feature-heavy they're going to feel comfortable and familiar. The landscape/zoom quality is horrid, but the macro mode on close-up objects did ok. The menu navigation is simple and fairly intuitive.,The 21 megapixel claims are meaningless - the sensor is tiiiiiny so there's not enough data to meaningfully fill in all those pixels. Picture quality is actually more like 10mp in most lighting conditions, and even in bright light I'd only say 12mp equivalent on landscape shots.,There's no control (like half-pressing the shutter button) that will show where the picture focus is. The view display is grainy enough that it's hard to tell just by looking, and there doesn't seem to be a way to zoom in in""view taken pictures"" mode to check focus after the fact. So just, point, click, and hope for the best.,If you're an adult looking for a cheap pocket camera you're not going to cry about losing, I ended up getting the Coolpix A10 for about twice as much as this thing (and that's without ANY accessories), but the A10 has some optical zoom and a bigger sensor so average picture quality is better even though it has less nominal mp.","July 1, 2019",3.0 out of 5 stars,Amazon Customer

All three performed as expected, really no issues. Picture quality is just ok. Not extremely to use, Takes a couple minutes to figure out how to navigate. Sound quality is horrendous.  When you un-box it your going to think, Oh man, What did I do? Mainly because the camera itself feels like its going to disintegrate in your hand it's so cheap and lighter than you think a camera should ever be. But, If you are buying a first camera, A throw away camera or intentionally looking to buy a cheap camera. This is your guy. We knew when we purchased these the kids were not going to take care of them anyway. If they made it for the two week vacation, Hey, Thank the Lord. And they did, all three. I would never buy this camera as my main camera or maybe even as a backup if I had a choice. You really get what you pay for in this case.

B07GPRSYG8,Nikon-Full-Frame-Mirrorless-Camera,Nikon Z6 Full Frame Mirrorless Camera Body,"I've had this camera for about a month now and feel like I've put it through enough scenarios to write a semi-informed review.,Overall I'm very pleased with the purchase and the performance of this mirrorless body.  The image quality is absolutely top notch.  The sensor and dynamic range combine to produce stunning images.  It handles low light/high ISO extremely well with the ability to venture into the 10,000 ISO and above without any hesitation.,The EVF is amazing, there's no lag and the view is sharp and accurate with regard to exposure and color white balance.,The XQD card technology is very fast and dependable.  I also enjoy the ergonomics of this body - it feels great in the hand and the button placements are spot on.,I'm currently using the FTZ adapter to utilize all my current F mount glass.  I'm not crazy about the extra weight and length this adds, but it's a necessity for the time being.  Over time I plan to switch to the native Z glass, whenever Nikon starts to release faster versions of the essential lens (ie. 70-200 f/2.8, etc...),Focus has been probably the weakest part of this camera.  Low light focusing isn't as good as DSLR.  The contrast detection system has a hard time grabbing focus on low contrast areas of the frame.  Also, the focus area modes are barely adequate.  Coming from D600 body, I miss my 3D modes and the ability to track fast moving objects.  The included focus modes on the Z6 are a bit tricky to get used to.,Battery life is lacking as compared to previous DSLR bodies.  I am able to use the camera on and off for most of the day if I'm just shooting my family events or out shooting a few landscape shots.  The battery will last fine for a typical family portrait session.  I'm concerned with shooting an entire wedding, as I have a feeling I'll be switching out batteris every couple hours.,Automatic JPEG transfer to iPhone via Snapbridge app and Bluetooth is useful and works quite well.  It's very handy to be able to shoot and share to social media quickly.  It works flawlessly and fairly quickly (JPEG transfers within about 15 sec.),Wireless transfer to PC via WiFi is a pain in the neck, is slow and buggy and very unreliable.  I may have a firewall or AV issue that's blocking the connection, but so far, I've only been successful at transferring to PC about 2 out of 20 times I've attempted it.  Setup of the PC connection is troublesome, confusing and buggy.,For the price, I have been very impressed with this new mirrorless tech from Nikon and always look forward to picking it up and going out shooting!","January 6, 2019",4.0 out of 5 stars,Dave Thompson
B07GPRSYG8,Nikon-Full-Frame-Mirrorless-Camera,Nikon Z6 Full Frame Mirrorless Camera Body,"I have owned the Z 6 now for about six months. It has quickly become my favorite camera and my first pick when I am selecting a camera to use. About me: I am a hybrid shooter. I shoot run and gun style family videos, timelapse, and the night sky. I have only shot on Nikon cameras as my support system all use Nikon professionally and will let me try out their glass before I purchase.  I have personally owned the D610 and still own D810 and D850.,Pros:,light,Z lenses (love the silent video autofocus),video autofocus,Sharp EVF,low light performance,IBIS-VR,Cons:,Lack of native, wide, fast lenses,EVF and monitor brightness difference,First off, I want to address the biggest complaint I have heard about this camera — dual card slots. Most of my cameras have had dual card slots, and I find myself using the second slot not to shoot redundant but to separate video and photo or as overflow for when I fill the first card. This was nice because as I purchased higher MP cameras, I did not buy larger cards, so it was nice to have the overflow onto the second card.  With my introduction to the XQD card on the D850, I choose to get 120 GB cards. They are expensive, but they are much faster. I would rather unload a full XQD card as compared to an SD card. Even the latest generation SD cards that I own are at least 1/3rd slower than my XQD card.,I love how light this camera is. When paired with f2.8 glass, this weight difference is not night and day different. However, when paired with the F-mount 50 f1.8 lens (my favorite adapted lens), the Z 6 is very light and very capable.,My favorite capability of the new system is the video autofocus. As a Nikon user who is not expert in manual focus, I love this feature. Nikon will continue to improve the autofocus system as shown by their efforts to add eye-AF. In close shots I think this AF system excels, I hope that future firmware updates will increase the functionality at further distances.,I find the in body VR to be very helpful. I am now hand holding shoots that I would have previously skipped without a tripod. When paired with a Z-mount lens, VR is improved even further.,Speaking of the z-mount lenses, they are the perfect partners to this new system. ESPECIALLY when it comes to AF and video! Silent AF paired with negligible focus breathing is fantastic! The 24-70 f2.8 s was my first native lens, but it won't be my last.,As mentioned earlier, I love shooting the night sky. To shoot without tracking, this requires a wide, fast lens. That is something this system lacks. I have used the 14-24 f2.8 f-mount adapted. This combo does give outstanding results. The adapter is just one more thing to pack/forget, which is why I am looking forward to the day a high performing native lens is available for astro on the Z-mount.,The display is super sharp, which makes checking focus on stars very easy.  When shooting the night sky, I use a loupe for checking focus on the D850 and D810. I found that the loupe is not needed on the Z 6. Additionally, the night sky is made easier with ISO invariance and improved performance (dual native?) at ISO 800.,As lenses will resolve with time, my only real con is the difference in brightness on the EVF and the monitor. Even on the lowest setting, I think the EVF is too bright and shows a picture brighter (higher exposure) than it will be exposed.  I think the monitor is accurate, but the EVF is too bright.,I wish they were matched in brightness.,Overall, I love this system. It has hiccups just like any system, but for my style of shooting it is excellent. I have no reservations saying to buy it. It is not going to make you a stand up videographer/photographer, no camera can. However, it makes the experience enjoyable for me, which means I am practicing more.","May 28, 2019",5.0 out of 5 stars,Spencer

B07GPRSYG8,Nikon-Full-Frame-Mirrorless-Camera,Nikon Z6 Full Frame Mirrorless Camera Body,"I love my Z6. It replaced a Fuji X-T2 that I shot (stills, rarely video) primarily with the pro-level 16-55mm f2.8 when traveling. I'm not a pro, nor am I coming from another full frame camera. The pics from the Z6 are far superior to the X-T2...better dynamic range, less noise (especially in low light), and the in-body image stabilization is fantastic. The 24-70 f4 kit lens is amazingly sharp. I think the Fuji Jpegs had slightly better color right out of the camera, but I always shoot and develop raw, so that doesn't matter to me, nor does the single card slot. Other things I like...lightweight, good control layout and grip for my big hands, good customization options, bright clear viewfinder. So far I find battery life at least double what is rated in the manual.  Negatives...no live highlight warning when shooting stills (it is in the play mode), kit lens has some vignetteing wide open (easy to fix in post), the customizable focus ring is a little too sensitive and easy to move accidentally (I deactivated it unless in manual focus mode). I haven't had any autofocus complaints, but I'm mostly shooting slow or static subjects in decent light. What low light focusing I've done has been fine. I haven't had any banding issues in post-production, where I rarely lift shadows more than 2 stops. 3 max. One warning...I was using Capture One version 12 in post, and I found the software would not apply the lens correction metadata embedded by the camera, so...the raw files looked terrible. I though it was the camera at first. I was very disappointed. Then I confirmed the issue with Phase One and subsequently switched to Lightroom. Problem solved. So, be prepared for disappointment if you're using Capture One 12.","March 21, 2019",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Andy C., Chicago"

This camera is amazing.  Unless you need razor sharp, large poster size images measured in feet and not inches, you don’t need to buy a Z 7.  This Z 6, combined with quality Nikkor lenses, delivers outstanding results with Z lenses as well as my F mount Nikkor lenses and the FTZ adaptor.  I am considering trading in my D 810 for a D 850.

B00HNJWUBI,Sony-DSCW830-Digital-Camera-2-7-Inch,Sony DSCW830 20.1 MP Digital Camera with 2.7-Inch LCD (Silver),"I was needing a small camera for product photography. I have a dslr, but wanted something smaller and comparable to a smart phone when it comes to quality and portability. After much research, I settled on the Sony DSCW830. Partially because of the reviews & price, and partially because my current dslr is a older Sony model which has a similar menu. I've already taken a bunch of test shots with it, and so far I'm really digging it. Now, don't get me wrong, this wont replace your dslr camera. I wouldn't use this to take action shots. This would not be my ""go to"" camera on Christmas morning, as it takes entirely too long for it to snap the picture ... However, for my needs it's perfect. The macro setting is where this camera really shines, as it takes very crisp photos of small subjects. It also seems to perform well for taking shots where the subject can sit still and pose for you. The video quality is more than sufficient and seems just as good, if not better than most smart phones. The battery life is good for this size of camera, and it charges up pretty quickly. All in all, it's a good little budget friendly camera if you use it for the right things.,Pros-,Size,Value,Quality,Easy menu system,Good for shooting 'still' subjects,Cons-,Doesn't come with a case,Not good for taking action shots","November 12, 2017",4.0 out of 5 stars,hera94

I am eager to try it out in the field tomorrow but initial impressions are positive.,I purchased and used the Fuji X-T3 for 5 days. I returned the camera for a refund today. I also own the Fuji Xt2 and Xt1 along with 7 of the Fuji lenses. I love Fuji stuff for the image and build quality and small form factor. I hope my disappointing experience with the Xt3 can be attributed to early build issues that get solved with more manufacturing time. My issues are as follows:,1. Everytime I switched on the camera, I received a message to use the NP-W126S battery, which was the battery loaded in the body and the same one the camera was shipped with. Even substituting another spare NP-W126S battery gave me the same warning every time the camera was switched on. Not only was this annoying, it also made it impossible to shoot images until the message cleared out.,2. Each time that I swapped out the battery, the camera lost all its initial settings like date, time and connection with the Fuji app.,3. The straw that broke the camel’s back for me was when the auto focus preferences that I stored were lost during one of these battery swaps and I wound up shooting a day’s worth of images completely out of focus.,I did perform a firmware update prior to using this camera, so I could only conclude that I had issues that would require more time and patience to solve than I possess. I must admit that I liked the way the camera handled, particularly for action shooting, so I hope my experience was an isolated example.

It takes excellent photographs, and the 60x optical zoom is amazing.  What is particularly surprising, and useful, is its ability to take great photos in dim light, without using the built-in flash; this was especially helpful in certain museum locations where flash was forbidden. It autofocuses very quickly as well. Sighting of the subject can be done by using the LCD screen (which is quite bright, even in bright sunlight) or, with the push of a button, through the small sighting slot just below the flash.  The flash, incidentally, must be manually raised and lowered for use, but this is quite easy and quickly done.","September 1, 2016",5.0 out of 5 stars,Robert Apfelzweig

Stabilization, Touch Enabled 3-Inch LCD, Wi-Fi, DC-FZ80K (Black)","I bought this camera for a recent trip across the southwest US. My first impression was that this camera is a bit bulkier than I expected. It is basically the same size as a DSLR, while many bridge cameras are smaller. The handgrip is good and it feels good and balanced when held.,The photo quality is just awesome. I am no professional by any means, but I do appreciate the quality of this camera and the photos it produces.,The things that I used quite a bit on the trip were the dedicated video button (you can start video recording at any time), photos during video (while recording, just snap pictures like normal) and the incredible zoom. While at the Grand Canyon especially, we used the zoom like a digital telescope to investigate things. I was sort of concerned that I wouldn't really use this camera's zooming capabilities, but I quickly found that I was capturing things and getting great crisp close ups of things that I would have passed on with my old digital camera; especially wildlife that we couldn't physically get close to. By the quality and clarity of the photos, you'd never know I was at least 50 to 100 yards away for many shots. The stabilization is outstanding, so at extreme zooms, you can count on crispness.,Another great thing that I noticed is how quickly the camera could get from a standing start - meaning turned off to on, then booted up, then zoomed, then focused, then capturing the photo. On our trip, many things would just happen quickly and getting the picture required a quick camera. My wife gave up trying to use her Samsung S3 to get any quick photos because I could grab the camera and complete a picture with the FZ70 in about 3 seconds, no kidding. It's like boom, it's on and ready.,I'm having some trouble forcing the flash on like the manual states. I have created my own program setting to accomplish this. I played with manual exposure settings to get some interesting effects. I tried to set it for extra long exposure times for star photos, but so far I can only get it to 60 seconds. There is a ton of options and settings, so I need to dig more.,Battery life is good and the camera feels rugged, yet not too heavy. I'm very pleased with this camera and it is a good buy for the money.","July 30, 2014",5.0 out of 5 stars,mohead

Oh, I could have spent twice the money on a ""better"" camera, but for my needs and the way I use a camera this one is just perfect. And, it seems - so far - the camera very well made. Note: I've owned Lumix cameras before so the learning curve (how to use the camera) is shorter. I'm very happy with my purchase...,A note on Amazons' packing... I was not at all happy with the packing. Amazon packed the FX70 in a box 3-times larger that the camera box and the amount of packaging material was next to nothing. So, the camera and the factory box rattled around inside the 'too large' Amazon box during,shipping. Luckily the factory box 'absorbed' any problems so the camera undamaged.","June 5, 2015",5.0 out of 5 stars,Diana Brown/Stephen Brown

I bought the DMC-FZ18 (8mp, 18X optical zoom) in 2007 and took some wonderful pictures with it. I love the EVF on both cameras., I made the mistake of putting a different brand on my wish list. Hubby surprised me on Christmas day with the other brand. I played with it but  realized it was so so good as the Panasonic brand. The other brand was returned and I ordered the FZ70 for next day delivery.,The other brand used 4 AA batteries that just didn't last.  Yes, there are rechargeable AA batteries I could purchase, but it's awkward carrying around multiple batteries like that. Two batteries had to be placed positive side up and two negative side up, but the diagram wasn't clearly marked under the battery door. The battery door felt flimsy and it was awkward to open. Lastly, I had trouble with the lens cap staying on the lens.,I like how Panasonic compartments have a way to keep the lithium ion rechargeable battery pack locked into position when the door opens. The charger and the battery pack are compact and not cumbersome to use.  There is only one way the battery can be inserted because of its shape., There are a lot more bells and whistles with the FZ70 but I don't plan to learn it all over night. I hope this digital camera lasts at least as long as the FZ18.","December 29, 2014",5.0 out of 5 stars,AZSnapSchotts

Stabilization, Touch Enabled 3-Inch LCD, Wi-Fi, DC-FZ80K (Black)","After having a small Sony Cybershot with only a 3X zoom (which actually took great pics), I decided to upgrade to another point and shoot with more zoom.  Looked around and researched similar cameras from Canon, Fuji, Sony, and Nikon, but decided on the Panasonic due to the wide angle feature.  I'm not a pro and probably will never use half of the features of this camera or even understand what they all mean.  I just want to put it in auto and go take pics.  Have already taken several hundred pics and I am very, very satisfied with this camera.  It takes awesome landscapes in low power/wide angle (my favorite pics to take) with awesome colors, crisp and sharp.  The zoom is phenominal and even with a tripod or monopod, you do lose some quality when zoomed all the way out, but still are good pics.  Although slightly larger than the other cameras, I like the size and ease of handling.  Really, the only negative I can think of is finding your way through the different menus and what all of the buttons and dials do... a little confusing, but I'm sure reading the electronic manual and using the camera over time will make it easier.  For the price, this camera is excellent and I recommend it, just don't expect it to be perfect in all areas and take pics like a high end camera. It's a point and shoot super-zoom that costs a couple hundred, to that end, it does an outstanding job IMO.","December 31, 2013",5.0 out of 5 stars,Rob7280

Indeed it was, I brought FZ70 with expedited shipping, as I was heading out to SF to see my son, daughter-in-law, and grandchildren and I wanted to be able to test it out during the trip.,My son, as a surprise gift, bought my wife and myself tickets aboard a tour ship that went out into the SF harbor to watch the America's Cup.  Our distance ranged from 1/3 to 3/4 miles from the racing craft and the zoom gave me exceptional photos.

I had little knowledge of photography or digital cameras before buying. This is definitely a great camera for beginners cause it comes with literally everything you might need to start out right. I probably read the directions for a good five minutes and found out it was better to play around with some of the semi-auto settings on my own and even went full on into manual mode to snap some shots. I'd say with all the stuff you get in this package it's a great value for the amount you spend.,"March 14, 2019",5.0 out of 5 stars,Justin Cassell

I don't expect much from it. But it turns out to be better than I expected.,It comes with 2 batteries, carrying pouch and strap.,It is very light and small.,This camera has proper flash and not the LED flash like those on the phone. This is powerful, sometimes I feel it is a bit too powerful and make the image a bit washout when it is too close to the object.,Usually with my other cameras, you can touch the lens easily and get the fingerprint mark on the lens. But the lens on this camera is very far back in the small hole, which you won't be able to get the finger to touch the camera lens.

I like this camera with rechargeable batteries! The battery will last a long time before I recharge it again. I don't have to worry about buying batteries. That's good. You just charge it with the power cord attached to it and it's ready to use. The 3-inch LCD screen is so big that you can see the image clearly before taking a picture, which I like very much.

However, the main issues I've had had to do with the CD (I don't know if my CD-ROM drive is going bad or what...), but in installing the drivers so I can upload photos from the camera to my computer, the CD never started or the screen for installation didn't come up. I had to go looking for the installation folder to get it to run. Once I got installed, I opened it so that I could download the few photos I took. Unfortunately, it showed a camera that I no longer have, and even clicking refresh in Photags didn't bring up the ABcam/Aberg Best. I was not able to locate the SD card on my computer to manually upload the photos. When I clicked on the link to go to the manufacturer's website, I got a warning from Microsoft Edge saying that my IP/server had notified someone that I was trying to do something regarding pornography! In order for me to continue using the computer, I had to call the Windows Online Help in order to resolve the issues. There is no way of contacting the manufacturer to obtain help immediately. I need to purchase an SD card reader in order to upload the photos.,If you're wanting a camera that you'll have to take to Walmart or one of the many pharmacies with a photo area in order to get hard copies, this camera is ok. The other thing I'd noted is that when I took pictures using the 21MP setting, they appear blurry and out of focus when viewing them on the LCD screen. At the lower MP settings, they appear to be perfect! I've used the 14, 16 and 18MP settings.

B00I8BIBCW,Sony-DSCW800-Digital-Camera-Black,Sony DSCW800/B 20.1 MP Digital Camera (Black),"I bought this camera mainly for work purposes. I have a Cannon Rebel XS DSLR, and this camera in no way compares to the quality of it. Of course I wasn't expecting it to. For this review I will focus on indoor shots of about 25 feet or under. I will start by saying low light, and even no light, performance is excellent. I tested it in my completely dark bedroom and the picture turned out as if it were brightly lit. I will say now that the colors do trend on the warm side. Subject tracking is a nice feature, great for moving objects, such as pets, and for people who have had to much coffee. It has an ""Easy Mode"" which is great for good casual shots, but I think that it's a little TO simple. It simplifies the menu choices to one: large images or small images. I personally think they should had left all of the sizes selectable in this mode. Video is limited to 1280x720, but this is more than enough for close up movies. The rated battery life is fairly short at 100 minutes, but this is most likely due to the viewscreen. Additional batteries are, as of this review, under $13 for the Sony battery NP-BN1, and half that for generics, which is very inexpensive for a camera battery. It charges via a special USB cable, which I hate, instead of a standard USB Type B which all small electrical devices seem to charge from, so be careful that you don't damage it. The included AC Adapter connects through the USB cable as well, and outputs 0.5A, so it is no faster than charging it from any other USB source.,All in all I would say this is a great camera for taking pictures up close, under 20 feet ideally. It's compact size, portability, features, and low cost make it a great camera for close up shots. It's not close to a DSLR quality, and I wouldn't think about using it to record once in a lifetime memories, but it's also less than 10% of the cost of a DSLR, and a great item to have around.","March 29, 2015",4.0 out of 5 stars,Matt

B07GPRSYG8,Nikon-Full-Frame-Mirrorless-Camera,Nikon Z6 Full Frame Mirrorless Camera Body,"Former Nikon N60 SLR and D200 DSLR owner, I have been holding out for Nikon's full frame mirrorless.  Like the title says, it is truly the best camera I've ever owned.  For the 1st time in my life, I have been able to take spectacular action photos in poorly lit high school basketball gyms.  I also purchased the full frame Nikkor Z 24-70mm lens with the body and also the FTZ adapter to use my old ""C"" size lenses.  I tried the FTZ adapter and it worked just fine, but after shooting full frame I'm struggling to go back.  It has taken some getting used to.  There has been a learning curve going from a D200 which has been fun to learn all the new features while still having the look and feel of a Nikon camera.  The one thing that is noticeably missing is the built-in flash (minor complaint).  It was either an oversight, or an attempt to go more Pro than Consumer.  I use fill flash alot and now have to carry along a much bigger external flash.  Overall, I'm very pleased with my Z6.","June 27, 2019",5.0 out of 5 stars,James S.

She has a photo business and had been wanting a mirrorless camera for quite some time.  She wanted to wait for Nikon's version since she already has lots of money invested in their lenses and she said it was well worth the wait!  I notice a huge difference in photo quality with the Z6 - the focus is lightning fast and very accurate, it's great in low light, and it has a silent shutter mode that is really nice for weddings and other events.  The only drawbacks are having only one memory card slot, and less battery life, but otherwise this thing is as good or better than the D850 (minus a few megapixels)!","March 2, 2019",5.0 out of 5 stars,Melissa Beninger

It's bright, clear, and so much easier to manually focus with.,Cons: Poor battery life, solid, but lower end controls, feels more delicate and heavier than expected.,Conclusion: If Nikon upgraded the D850 to an EVF I'd sell my soul for it.  Can't wait to see what semi pro - pro Nikon mirrorless bodies will come in the future.  But, these cameras will slow down Nikon users from converting to Sony.,P.S. I loved the 24-70mm f4 lens.

B07H49QWN4,Fujifilm-X-T3-Mirrorless-Digital-Body,Fujifilm X-T3 Mirrorless Digital Camera (Body Only) - Silver,"I own X-T2 w/grip, X-T20, lots of Fuji glass, former Nikon FF shooter (since FM/FE), Minolta since SRT-101, M 4/3, did my own B&W darkroom back in the day, freelance/wedding photographer out of HS for a number of years.,The X-T3 is a stellar achievement in features/functionality/performance/price.  Fuji is hands down the best value today.  Ergonomics generally are heads above everyone else.  Generally stellar glass.  Fuji APS-C IS the best bang for the buck for most photographers including most 'PRO' work today.,I've had X-T2 for over a year and its a solid workhorse.  Have borrowed an X-T3 and I'm glad I borrowed one and did not purchase it.  Why?  There is somethings odd about the top of the camera that I really don't like.,1)  The top right dial section is too busy.  The nubs on the dials remind me of the Oly OM-D EM-10 II which could cut you if you weren't careful.  There is too much going on in this section on the upper right.  I was immediately put off by that area of the controls layout.  Yes, it is similar to the X-T2, but the designers moved in the EV +/- dial and it is harder to get to.  The buttons just look weird now, especially on the silver model.  They are trying to be too 'pretty' if you know my I mean.,2) The top left plate on the other side of the hot shoe is also a little weird.  I like the locking diopter adjustment.  But why is that piece of metal coming out of the top pointing towards the ISO ring?  Is is a loop or a bend, what do you call it?  It looks weird like someone dropped in a part from a totally unrelated device at the top of the camera.,It feels like design elements of a bare metal 'styling' from the X-A or X-100 series are creeping into the X-T line which is a shame.  I really dislike the X-100 series because of the weird interplay and proportions of bare metal, space, knobs, and the odd X-100 LCD panel.  The proportions seem forced and unbalanced.  More like a Kiev 4A Type-2 rather than say a Leica or Zeiss Ikon.,Its getting to the point where the design is trying to make an artistic statement that is out of place.  Like a bad note in a chord.  Anything when overplayed, including design, tends to fail.  X-T2 was more attractive here because the 'coolness' in the design was not trying to overplay the utility of the controls.  X-T3 is trying too hard to be pretty.,If I needed to have another X-T heavyweight, I would certainly get another X-T2 and not the X-T3.  I'll wait and see if Fuji comes back to their design senses with the X-T4.","November 20, 2018",3.0 out of 5 stars,MysticJaguar
B07H49QWN4,Fujifilm-X-T3-Mirrorless-Digital-Body,Fujifilm X-T3 Mirrorless Digital Camera (Body Only) - Silver,"It took me a while to decide between the X-T2 and the X-T3, especially since I had picked a T2 in graphite silver for $1,299 and it was made in japan. At the end of the day, for my needs either camera would have sufficed (mostly portraits and landscapes). However, after holding and feeling my way around both, I realized that the X-T3 was a better fit for my large hands, small things made a big difference, including the additional depth of the grip, the larger buttons in the back and the newly designed switches for the drive mode and metering. The larger X-T3 just felt right, without trying to convince myself of which was the right camerA. The made in China part sort of faded in the background given the solidity of the camera build, as many others have commented. It truly feels substantial.,I do wish that the camera operated a little more swiftly, coming from a Canon 5D Mark III, it feels just a tad slower, especially when reviewing a photo I just took. However, the same applies when navigating through the menus. I do think that Canon menus are the best, here I still have to stop and think where things are.,Photo quality is excellent and the autofocus is pretty quick, no complaints here. Photos at ISO 6400 in raw resemble the files of my 5D, they have a similar grain pattern that i actually like.,Overall, it is a very nice camera and I hope it holds up for as many years as my 5D did. When using it, I invariably have moments where I think, boy that works really well, whether adjusting aperture via the rear command dial or ISO settings via clicking the front command dial, or using the four way controller buttons as shortcuts to various functions.,I hope you enjoy yours as much as I enjoy mine.","November 1, 2018",4.0 out of 5 stars,Jamesporter

B07H49QWN4,Fujifilm-X-T3-Mirrorless-Digital-Body,Fujifilm X-T3 Mirrorless Digital Camera (Body Only) - Silver,"Wow, coming from an XT2 I was missing my Full Frame Nikon, for the supposed added DOF and extra DR. So I decided to go back to FF (using the Nikon Df, which has the D4 sensor). I was liking the results, but the weight and heft was something that was undesirable. When the XT3 came out, I saw all the love that the camera was receiving especially on the focus and face detect, so I decided to buy a used one, and OMG. I didn’t realize I had missed the Fuji experience this much. I thought that with the APSC sensor I was at a bigger disadvantage with the points mentioned earlier, but that was clearly not the case. FujiFilm has really done an excellent job with their sensor. I’m sure possibly in low light, this camera will suffer some, but I’ve shot at 6400 iso withou seeing any real issue. I am more of a stills shooter, so I can’t comment on the battery life when shooting video, but for stills, I think it’s plenty (just make sure you shut camera off when not using). All in all I’m excited with this new toy, and don’t miss the FF weight and heft at all. Don’t wait to buy one just go get one!","March 1, 2019",5.0 out of 5 stars,Victor
B07H49QWN4,Fujifilm-X-T3-Mirrorless-Digital-Body,Fujifilm X-T3 Mirrorless Digital Camera (Body Only) - Silver,"The Fujifilm X-T3 is an excellent camera.  The performance and ergonomics of the camera are great.  I was looking a mirrorless platform to switch and decided to try out the Fujifilm X-T3 after doing some extensive research about the options available in the marketplace.  I have been very impressed with the responsive and ease of use of the camera.  I like that the controls are on the outside of the body.  I don't have to dive into menus to change features like the shutter speed, aperture, or ISO.  The Q menu is logical.  I like the design of the GUI that the Fujifilm X-T3 employs.  Eye auto focus is very reliable.  The colors from the Fujifilm X-T3 are amazing.  SOOC shots are beautiful.  I have been using the X-T3 as my primary camera for over the past 7 months now without any problems.  I don't miss my Nikon D810 in any way.  The features and capabilities of the Fujifilm X-T3 can stand up against any full frame or crop sensor camera on the market today.  Fujifilm does an excellent job with supporting the Fujifilm X-T3 through firmware updates that are incredibly easy to install using the Fujifilm app on my iPhone.  I would definitely recommend this camera for portraiture.  If you are looking for a camera that will inspire you to use it and is reliable, look no further than the Fujifilm X-T3.  You won't be disappointed.,I do wish the camera had IBIS.  I believe Fujifilm will release an update version of the X-T series camera with IBIS.","July 27, 2019",5.0 out of 5 stars,Eric H. Adeleye
B07H49QWN4,Fujifilm-X-T3-Mirrorless-Digital-Body,Fujifilm X-T3 Mirrorless Digital Camera (Body Only) - Silver,"There’s no need to write an in-depth review as there’s many out there on the internet already so I’m gonna keep this short.,The X-T3’s autofocus system is simply a massive upgrade over the X-T2 and is definitely worth upgrading to if you need the best autofocus performance in a Fujifilm camera. The image quality seems about the same as my X-T2, though DP Review and others have noted slightly worse high ISO performance so keep that in mind if a super quick autofocusing system is not necessary for your work and you’re looking for the best image quality in the Fujifilm X system.,The lack of IBIS is a bummer as most of its Full Frame competition already sports it and the battery life is mediocre at best. I’m pretty optimistic that Fujifilm will address these problems in their next X-H body at which point I may probably step up to that line.,The build quality is great as always despite Fujifilm moving its production from Japan to China.,I’m quite excited to truly test its capabilities on my next birding trip.","November 22, 2018",5.0 out of 5 stars,Isa

Focused perfectly on the object of interest with no blind showing.  Great travel camera and easy to learn its intricacies.  Can’t beat the lens either.

B019UDHT6U,Canon-PowerShot-Digital-Camera-Stabilization,Canon PowerShot ELPH 180 Digital Camera w/Image Stabilization and Smart AUTO Mode (Red),"UPDATE OCT 2016,Canon replaced the camera with a ""new or refurbished unit"" and this one has been working fine. I am grateful for Canon's warranty work but my sense is not to increase the review rating given that the issue seems quite widespread with this model. Those who are unlucky enough to have it strike after the warranty period are out of luck.,UPDATE SEP 2016,I'm sorry to say this camera has now started experiencing the dreaded focus problems that other reviewers have complained about. It still turns on and lets me select different modes, but will not take a focused picture. I got less than 6 months of use out of it - no drops, spills, or weather exposure. I'll try to get a warranty repair or exchange but I'm not optimistic.,As an aside, I have to say as a long-time Canon photography devotee that this is yet another Canon product that has not lived up to expectations. Other failures have included a Canon mid-level DSLR, 50 mm prime lens, and even a (very expensive) L lens which did give me years of service, but for that price should have given me years more.,***** ORIGINAL REVIEW *****,Long ago when I lived in Japan, I owned an earlier version of this camera when it was called IXY and it only had 4.0 megapixels. I loved it then and I love it now!,Full disclosure: I'm a photography nut and I usually take pictures with a full frame DSLR. In my experience there's simply no substitute for a quality full sized sensor and the lens to go with it.,But the philosophical side of photography tells us that the best picture is the one you get, not the one you missed because your equipment was too heavy or bulky to take with you. This little camera is a point-and-shoot dream. Out of the box, the thing just works. If you stand in the right place, point the camera in the right drection, and push the button at the right moment, you get a well exposed, color balanced, perfectly focused photography. From a camera that will fit in your front jeans pocket.,The battery lasts for a subjective forever - I've taken it on photo-heavy vacation and a single charge lasted most of the week. There are ample customizable modes if you want to tinker - from macro to exposure modes to filters and effects. To be honest, I never use them. The camera is good enough to get me what I need in its default mode. It has saved my bacon more than once when my primary DSLR was unavailable or impractical for the task at hand, and I needed something small and light that could still take a quality picture.,It's not the fanciest or most feature heavy camera you can find, but it's a great little workhorse that I wouldn't hesitate to recommend to anyone.","July 18, 2016",1.0 out of 5 stars,Tom

B07GPRSYG8,Nikon-Full-Frame-Mirrorless-Camera,Nikon Z6 Full Frame Mirrorless Camera Body,"Very fun to use a touch screen and have video AF at 4k.  I am mostly a nikon shooter with a bunch of f mount lenses.  Very happy that the adapter works well with my lenses.  I have own and used nikon d750, d600, DF, D7000, D40.  Had the panny Gm1 and sony A7, both gone.  A few quirks and things I noticed:,1. Since I shoot manual it was real time exposure, but after I asked somebody and he said you can adjust the manual exposure to be able to see under d8.  Good for studio shooter and night shooter that need to see their subject.,2. For video I think the AF jumps more for Nikon F lens vs S lens?  You can adjust the the video AF sensitivity under g4 or g5.  I also noticed this for still image too.,3. The Fn1 button I use as my zoom.  To check the focus as I look thru the viewfinder.,4. I keep on hitting the record button as the iso, which I used it as a iso button on the d750.,5. EVF is very good, don't missed the OVF as much as I thought I would.,6. Battery drain was big, I used the rear lcd a lot.  get spare batteries.,7.  Nikon nef looks like how it is on nikon first party capture nx as it does on 3rd party software lightroom and capture 1 pro.  I am using dng for lightroom as I have the old version.,8. touch screen is fun to use and focus well at night (tad jumpy).,9. can focus at the corner of the frame now.,10. face detect works well at least at f2.2 on the eyes.  Didn't test how shallow it can go.  Guess it depends on working distance too.,11. works with my trigger and flash, except for the IR AF-assist as that doesn't work for milc in general.,12. Have tested it on sport or action and does fine, I might give a edge to the d750.  Night shooting and it did focused at night better then I thought.,13. wished it had a vertical grip option not just battery pack.,14. I use the i button alot to change AF system.  Grant the fn2 button does that for AF settings, but I don't remember to use it much.,15. I don't use the joystick as much.  Either it autofocus on the face, or I use the touch screen af and look at the evf and use the zoom fn1.  Half of my shoot is just the rear lcd.  Nikon should have an option to use the rear lcd to move the af like other cameras for when looking at the evf.,16. You need an external video capture for 10bit recording at 4k, otherwise you got 4k at 8bit.,17. the kit 24-70 f4 is a great lenses for walk around.  Get it as a combo price is much better then the full price.  It feels solid, not sure why people say it feels cheap.  It is short too, so you have to extend it before use.  People call it retractable lens.,18. Since this milc has less external buttons must program your favorite commands to the external free button or the ""I"" button.  I found split screen zoom a unique features.,19. read the manual, many new features and settings that will effect your shooting to adjust not found on nikon dslr.,Positives:,1. built quality, very nice metal.,2. grip is good maybe between the d750 and d5600 size.,3. Image quality is good, I think it is on par with the d750.,Negatives:,-Batteries doesn't last as long as dslr.,-body size is great for most people who like lightweight, but maybe small if you have xxl hands.,-less external buttons then dslr.,-Af in video needs a lot of adjustments, learning or maybe some updates.,-When usign the adapter you must remove the tripod mount if you have one.,It you have bunch of nikon lenses this is a great new tech to play with.  Don't see much draw back.  I am keeping the d750 for that as my main sport camera.  this z6 can do sport action for sure, but the d750 does it a little better, I think.","December 2, 2018",4.0 out of 5 stars,®ichard
B07GPRSYG8,Nikon-Full-Frame-Mirrorless-Camera,Nikon Z6 Full Frame Mirrorless Camera Body,"NOTE: This is a review of the Nikon Z6 Filmmaker's Kit, not the Nikon Z6 itself.  The camera is great. This ""kit"", on the other hand, is incredibly frustrating and incomplete. 3 stars is generous for it, but I don’t want to give the camera a bad rep just because the kit is a mess.,First and foremost, in order to USE everything that comes in this kit, you will need to ALSO purchase the following:,An XQD Memory card (unless you think you’ll always be using the Atomos Ninja V to record on),An XQD Memory card reader,A Solid state hard drive (in order to use the included Atomos Ninja V),A Hard drive dock (in order to get anything you’ve recorded on the SSD onto your computer),At least one NP-F batteries (unless you like being connected to an electrical outlet with the included cord and don’t plan to move around while using the Atomos Ninja V with the gimbal),At the time of this review, all of that ran my company an extra half grand to purchase. It was not fun telling my superiors that the money they’d already approved would not be enough.,So after that was all taken care of, here is a list of other stupid things related to the kit that I discovered:,1) It comes with a great Rode mic.  However, you can’t use it in conjunction with the gimbal, because it will slam into the mic if you tilt it even slightly.,2) The gimbal comes with several cords to connect it to various camera brands. However – get this – it DOES NOT COME WITH A CORD THAT WILL CONNECT TO THE NIKON CAMERA IT IS PACKAGED WITH. How ridiculous is that? It appears that I need a USB-C to USB-C cable. One more part I have to buy. So until I get that, I cannot use the gimbal to start and stop recording, or to adjust any camera settings. I have to press buttons on my camera with my off hand.,3) The kit comes with an HDMI to mini-HDMI cord to connect the camera to the Atomos Ninja. The camera comes with a clip to keep the mini-HDMI from slipping out.  However, the mini-HDMI end of the cord that comes with the kit is TOO FAT TO FIT THROUGH THE CLIP. Absurd.,4) Once you connect the Atomos Ninja V to the articulating arm and the arm to the gimbal and the HDMI to the camera, it isn’t really possible to use the gimbal correctly because the coiled cord is so heavy it pulls on the camera and unbalances it.  Also, all of this put together is extremely heavy, so unless you lift a lot, bro, you’re not going to want to carry this whole monstrosity around for more than a couple minutes.,I will be using the gimbal with the camera.  I will be using the Rode mic.  I will be using the Atomos Ninja V. But I will NOT be using them all together at the same time, because it's just not practical (or in some cases, even possible).,When all is said and done, the designers of this kit had so little concern for the needs of the customer that it has kinda soured me on Nikon as a whole, which is really disappointing.","February 26, 2019",3.0 out of 5 stars,David R
B07GPRSYG8,Nikon-Full-Frame-Mirrorless-Camera,Nikon Z6 Full Frame Mirrorless Camera Body,"For years I wanted a mirrorless camera, though I never pulled the trigger because I couldn't use my Nikon lenses. The new Z mirrorless system from Nikon was worth the wait.,If you suspect the Z cameras have disadvantages over a high-end DSLR, do not worry, there are NO DISADVANTAGES!. The autofocus is spot on and fast, the metering is perfect. And the mirrorless design lets you see exactly what the final picture will look like, including depth of field, white balance, and exposure in the OLED viewfinder or rear display.,The build has the same high quality as the D850, with a magnesium alloy housing and weather sealing. It feels perfect in my hand. It fits my hand better than DSLRs. Clearly, Nikon made ergonomics a priority with this design. All of the functions are easily reachable with my fingers and thumb, allowing me to make adjustments with only one hand. And the internal VR features are outstanding, as is the silent mode that allows for truly silent shooting, even in burst mode.,The Z6 has fewer megapixels than the Z7, which allows for smaller file sizes, faster buffering and faster writing to the single XQD card. It also allows for higher FPS in burst shooting mode. Additionally, the Z6o has better low-light capabilities with native ISO up to 51200, twice as high as the Z7.,For most people there is no reason to use a DSLR if they have this camera. The superior ergonomics, lighter weight, and equal or better performance make it a no brainer. My DSLR is now my backup.,It took a while for Nikon to get it right, and it was worth the wait. The Nikon Z system is the new standard for mirrorless systems.","December 15, 2018",5.0 out of 5 stars,Miller
B07GPRSYG8,Nikon-Full-Frame-Mirrorless-Camera,Nikon Z6 Full Frame Mirrorless Camera Body,"I bought the Filmmaker's kit directly from Nikon with their upgrade program due to a generous trade-in.,The Filmmaker's kit comes with an external recorder/monitor and gimbal for extra-steady shots. But it is not really possible to use it ""out of the box."" I'm not going to do an in-depth review of the Z6 or the other components - many people have done very thorough reviews of those. Instead, I want to help you get started quickly by highlighting a few things.,Additional things you need to have or buy:,SSD Drives for the Atomos Ninja V. Any 2.5"" drive will work. You do not need to buy the extra-compact Atomos editions. Standard 2.5"" drives are used with drive caddies (1 included in the box, you can buy packs of 5 for $30), and they project out the side a bit more than half an inch. Some might consider this beneficial, since it could provide some protection for the HDMI plugs from being knocked around. The special Atomos drives are far more expensive but fit flush to the unit with no projection. I bought 2 500GB Samsung 860 SSDs that are doing great as first recording units. They each hold more than 4 hours of 4K N-Log video. If I start using RAW (available in a future update) I likely will get some larger capacity units.,Batteries for the Atomos Ninja V. The unit ships with an AC adapter, but unless you plan on only shooting next to an AC outlet, that is pretty useless. It takes standard Sony-style NP-F batteries, and there are numerous options available. They recommend at least a 5200mAh battery for 2 hours of monitor/record time, and you can buy larger/heavier batteries as well. Beware that most sellers on Amazon do not offer a fast charger. This could mean very long charging times for the batteries, especially higher capacity batteries.,XQD Card for the Nikon Z6. At least 400Mb/s. I think most all cards sold do that now. I have used both Sony and Lexar with fine results in previous cameras. There is only one slot, so no backup capability. I've never had an XQD fail on me, but there's always a first time. So I will probably stick with 64GB cards and download them often to limit exposure to problems.,Options:,A hood for the Ninja V is awfully nice. Rather than pay the ridiculous price for a ""genuine"" plastic one, I made a foldable cardboard one.,A different HDMI cable - the coiled cable is nice and compact to connect the camera to the Ninja V, but is so tightly coiled that it interferes with the gimbal balance. The gimbal is strong enough to overcome this, but it's an annoyance. Also the connector on the coiled cable is too wide to use Nikon's cable clamp on the Z6, which if you're having the HDMI stick out a lot, might be good as protection. I have a habit of whacking and damaging cables and connectors.,Comments:,I love the Z6. It feels good. The battery life is shorter than my other cameras, but not really something to complain about. Auto-upload to SnapBridge on a smartphone uses a lot of battery, but is great for geo-tagging and viewing your pictures. I was disappointed to not find an artificial horizon in the menus, until I found it as one of the normal pages shown with the DISP button. And it's particularly good! I chose the D6 for it's better low-light sensitivity and all-pixel use of the sensor for 4K video. And it has delivered very well. It's a great all-around camera.,The Ninja V - If you want HDR type recording (and you do, if you want to high-end video), you need to use an external recorder. The camera will not record N-log (and presumably not raw in the future update) to an internal card. If you want standard recording, you can ditch the monitor and record in-camera. XQD cards are expensive compared to SSDs, and you can store a lot of video on an SSD.  The Ninja V is a nice compact unit. Not lightweight including a battery. Several nice monitoring options. An additional stereo analog audio input supplements audio in the HDMI from the camera. The camera can send timecode to the Ninja V.,The Moza Air 2: makes superb steady video. Lots of stabilization modes with separate on/off and responsivity for each axis. If you want focus or zoom control, you need to get the separate iFocus module. Theoretically the gimbal has Nikon USB control through the USB-C on the Z6, but I haven't gotten that to work. Also, even if it does work, with current firmware very few functions are even theoretically available - basically just the record trigger. Perhaps a future update will bring exposure control, and even better, USB focus control. Focus pulls and zooms are unwieldy and will jiggle the camera when done manually. This is a heavy unit. The Ninja V is difficult to mount with the included arm in a fashion that will keep it from sagging. If mounted to the right side, it will unscrew itself. There are optional brackets that would solve that problem. With camera and Ninja V, this is a very heavy combination that will give you a solid workout.","March 26, 2019",4.0 out of 5 stars,Peter Henry
B07GPRSYG8,Nikon-Full-Frame-Mirrorless-Camera,Nikon Z6 Full Frame Mirrorless Camera Body,"I placed an order of the Nikon Z6 with the 24-70 mm and FTZ adapter the same week Nikon announced the product. It was worth the wait when this new gadget arrived. The Z6 is Nikon's first entry to the mirrorless market with a full frame digital sensor for the serious photographers. I have been having fun with this camera for over a week before sharing my experience. My first impression is that Nikon has done a nice job as a first generation mirrorless camera.,The camera has a beautiful easy to grip body weighting 1209 grams (about 2.7 lb) with the 24-70 mm Z lens attached. The modes dial is located on the left with the typical M, A, S, P, and Auto modes plus three users defined modes.  The selection dial is located on the right for setting ISO, shutter speed, and aperture etc. There is an ISO selection button located next to the power on switch for quickly adjusting the ISO by using the selection dial.  It has a beautiful electronic viewfinder with a diopter knob for those wearing eyeglasses. The monitor measures about 2 5/8"" W x 1 3/4"" H with a beautiful tiltable touch-screen functionality. By pressing the display mode button, we can cycle the monitor's display from live view to a variety of camera parameters . The i button to the right of the monitor provides an easy access to a variety of camera controls (eg metering mode, auto focus mode, image quality, white balance, flash mode just to name a few). What's really neat is that we can customize the i menu to our own shooting style with the most used settings. We can also program the Fn 1 and Fn 2 buttons located next to the lens for quick customized settings. Above the i button is a small joystick which is normally used to single / pin-point focusing.,There a a wealth of selection on the image quality with a combination of Raw, JPEG basic, JPEG fine, and JPEG fine *. I did a test shot of 27 photos with the highest quality settings (Raw + JPEG fine *) which took about 1GB of storage. This is not bad as this would translate to over 3000 picture at the highest quality setting with a 120 GB XQD memory card (provided that we don't take videos with it).,Taking video with the Z6 is a dream comes true for a camera. The Z6 supports true 4K video with a maximum of 3840 x 2160 UHD at upto 30 fp. We can also customize the i menu tailored to video shoots when we are in the  video camera mode. This video quality so far is one of the best I have taken with any 4K video camera.,The 24 - 70 mm fixed F4 Z lens is great for general photo shoots. So far the test shoots I did resulted super sharp pictures without any edge distortions. With the Z6's maximum 51200 ISO , this lens takes great shots for low light environment. The FTZ adapter weights about 163 grams (5.8 oz) which is not bad. I tried it with my DX zooms lens which worked pretty well. The DX crop mode seemed to be automatically selected when the lens is attached. As of this writing, there are only three Z lens on the market. Nikon is going to produce 6 additional Z lens in 2019 including a 70 mm - 200 mm F2.8 zoom lens. In the mean time, I would settle with my NIKKOR 28-300mm ED VR lens with the FTZ adapter.,So far my general impression of the Z6 is great. I am not a professional photographer but the packed features and functionality will make me go a long way. I also bought the Nikon DSLR bag (model 9793) for my Z6 kit which fits quite well so far. For those who are new to Nikon's raw format, it uses the NEF file format which would require using the latest DNS converter to convert the files to DNS for post-processing with the Adobe Photoshop. One of the slight drawback with the Z6 is its shorter battery life in comparison I would highly recommend stocking up some spares El-51b for photo-shooting trips.","November 25, 2018",5.0 out of 5 stars,Gadgetman

B07GPRSYG8,Nikon-Full-Frame-Mirrorless-Camera,Nikon Z6 Full Frame Mirrorless Camera Body,"The Z6 with the FTZ adapter and 24-70 f4 S lens is an unbeatable Nikon mirrorless for one of my styles of shooting - street photography.  Armed with an FX lens on the FTZ adapter it makes an excellent landscape camera.  I don’t do Portrait work, but can imagine it excellent for that as well.  It’s only weakness, and it may be firmware, or it may be the AF-C, but I can’t see this for sports or wildlife.  It is missing a reliable group mode, 3-D tracking, and generally struggles a bit with tracking focus on birds in flight.  Maybe with more experience there might be mastery, butright now, nothing can replace my D500 or D850 (or the D5) in photographing high speed events with precise tracking.  But it is a spectacular initial foray into mirrorless, and a no brainer for owners of Nikon FX gear who want a slightly lighter and more compact body without sacrificing your investment in quality Nikon lenses.","November 27, 2018",5.0 out of 5 stars,Marc R.

It was the perfect size to slip into my front pocket and carry around with me.  I took almost 300 shots, most of them decent.  The only negative I found was with image stability.  If I used any zoom at all, pictures tended to come out blurry.  Once I figured that out, I was able to compensate.,I used the panorama mode a lot to capture the skyline...in my opinion, this one feature makes the camera worth purchasing.

Prior to this camera, I had a Fuji X100 and a Canon 7D. My Canon was good but very heavy. I loved the X100 but wanted to zoom for when I took photos at events. This camera is very suitable for documenting weddings, parties, landscapes and portraits. My wedding photos were captured with this camera, and they came out great.

It is very fast and responsive, the controls are very well thought out and intuitive, and it is very well built.  Image quality is superb, especially outdoors and shooting with it is plenty of fun.,The reason for the 4 stars, however, is that while it is the best APS-C camera, it is sold at a price point where for USD200 more, one can buy a FF sensor camera.  Where the XT-3 suffers is in low light performance, which while good, is no match for a FF sensor, especially considering that its main FF competitor is about the same size with very similar outstanding features but also with IBIS which the Fuji lacks (maybe less so on the video side but that's about it).","September 25, 2018",4.0 out of 5 stars,B

B01MRCWQRM,Nikon-26518-COOLPIX-A10,Nikon COOLPIX A10,"Upon receiving the camera, I could tell I wouldn't like it. It's very small. I put it away with the intent to use it right away, but kept leaving it at home. When I did get around to using it, I was not impressed with the quality of photos and just the overall functionality of it. I really wanted to like it, so I held on to it and told myself I just had to get used to it. I kept it in a camera bag with my other Kodak instant camera and when I took it out again to use it, the camera wouldn't work. The lens wouldn't open, somehow it got jammed. Not sure how because I took very good care of it and I kept it in the same bag with my Kodak and the Kodak works perfectly fine. Heck, I've even dropped my Kodak instant camera and it STILL works two years later. Luckily, I was still within my warranty window so I set up a repair. I returned the camera on May 21st and we are now in July and I have yet to get my camera back. I keep checking for repair updates and it's been in ""repair on hold"" status for weeks. Unfortunately, it's too late for me to return it and get my money back but I would if I could in a heartbeat. I purchased this camera with the intent on having a camera I could travel around with and take pictures instead of always using my phone since the phone battery dies out fast. I'm not a pro with camera's so I wanted something of good quality but affordable and easy to use.

Even at full 60X zoom [in sun], the photos were focused and the colors pretty accurate. Indoor photos with flash had to be white balanced but came out pretty good; though I liked the color balance better without flash. When I am watching these photos on my 27"" monitor they are pretty good; however, if I digitally zoom in 2 or 3 steps, the photos pixilate, show noise [especially when camera automatically switched to iso 400 or greater] or indicate they were not focused over the entire photo [espec. if depth of field was over 10-20 meters]. Check out sample of Panama Canal on a rainy/cloudy day, and statue in Guatamala on a sunny day with plants.,But for a camera with a 1/2.3"" sensor and such a great flexibility in lenses and shooting mode- I am very happy with the quality of photos and videos I got with this camera.

Stabilization, Touch Enabled 3-Inch LCD, Wi-Fi, DC-FZ80K (Black)","I bought this camera simply because of the awesome zoom range... I believe it's the only super zoom camera with the 20 to 1200mm range. At $227 price here on Amazon, it's just one heck of a deal if you ask me. Is the photo quality as good as  $3000 to 5000 dollar large sensor camera's with 2 or 3 different expensive zoom lenses that you'd have to have to get this same zoom range? No, but it's a few thousand dollars less expensive too!,Now, with that being said, I am actually pretty pleased with the image quality out of this camera and even find the low light abilities to be pretty good as well. I don't need to use the flash even inside with low lighting and the pictures come out pretty good. This camera has numerous different settings, more than I'll ever use. But I find the automatic settings work great for almost everything I want to do. I'm not a professional and not a photography nut either.... but I'd say this camera gives me as good of pictures as any I have ever owned... and given that's even when using the massive 60X zoom, I am VERY pleased with this camera.,The video recording works pretty good on this camera too. Now don't be fooled by Panasonic saying it will do 60fps, this just isn't true and is a mis-leading thing Panasonic puts out there. If you look at the specs where they say it can do 60fps, you'll see an asterisk that says the sensor output is at 30fps.... you know what that means? It means this camera will only give you 30fps output, not 60fps. They arrive at 60fps by duplicating frames. So you really aren't recording at 60fps. This is not an issue for me with most of my video recording and the video out of this camera actually looks very nice. But if I am recording something with lots of high speed motion, I would use my Sony Camcorder or GoPro so I have the actual 60 or 120 fps recording speeds.,In conclusion without getting into techy stuff, for this price range, and having the massive 60X zoom, I'd say this camera performs exceedingly well! I find the auto modes just simply produce great pictures very consistently, it just works! It also has many manual settings you can use as well, so I think it's a great all around camera. I think this is the camera I will use most often.,I've attached some pictures to show the quality in varying lighting conditions. I've ordered them in sequence so you can see the zoom progression from near to far. All these pics were taken in intelligent Auto mode, except for a couple that I shot in HDR.","September 12, 2015",5.0 out of 5 stars,Bob Eddelman

Stabilization, Touch Enabled 3-Inch LCD, Wi-Fi, DC-FZ80K (Black)","Wow what a camera!  I have had many, many cameras over the years from film to digital.  This is for me the best I have ever owned.  I love the way it takes pictures and all of the options available through its settings.  I bought this camera after doing lots of research and decided to pay a bit more so I could have both a wide angle and long lens in one camera.  I have a Canon with lots of lenses but truth be told I no longer want to be lugging around a heavy camera bag and tripod.  With the Lumix I can point and shoot or adjust speed and aperture to my hearts content.  My vacation has been greatly enhanced with this camera and the shots I have taken are vastly superior to anything I can take with my cell phone.  It has a number of creative settings which function like filters for close-ups, scenery or special effects.  It also does double duty as a 4k film camera for short takes.  I also like the Panorama setting that allows you to get a wide landscape shot to capture more of the surrounding environment.  One caution is to be very careful when ordering extra rechargeable batteries.  By mistake I bought a battery that fit perfectly but would not charge.  When I investigated further it turned out to be a battery for the FZ70.  So be extra careful and make sure the battery is for the FZ80.  Also, on that note the camera thus far has held up to a full day of photography.  I have had to recharge at the end of each day so having extra batteries on hand is a good idea.,This is a very nice piece of photographic equipment.  No complaints thus far and I can recommend it without hesitation.","July 26, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,Ferniez

The zoom is incredible, and of course requires steady hands to get the best shot possible.  That said, the image stabilizer helps and you can actually take reasonably clear shots zoomed in by hand.  I was at a ball game the other night, and from my seat, the entire park fit in the frame of a single picture.  Zooming in, without digital zoom (60x), the batter would fill more than the screen and I was able to see footprints in the dirt...,I also took the camera to the races, and after a handful of attempts was able to get a classic picture with a clear car and blurry background.  That takes a little more skill to accurately track the car so it remains clear.  Easy to use, and the battery life actually lasted much, MUCH, longer than I was expecting.  Leaving the camera on, allowing it to sleep when it wants, I would be able to take fairly nonstop pictures all day I did buy 2 extra (generic) batteries as I plan to take this on a two week trip to Peru, but I am confident that it will have enough life.

I've considered getting the gear necessary to take good photos, but the investment, both in dollars and weight, is significant.,Finally, a camera comes along made for people like me. It is small and light enough to carry around all day, yet capable of taking great photos. The lens extends to provide 60x optical zooming, coupled with superior image stabilizing firmware that I find myself snapping away. If the birds are distant, well, you at least have a record shot. However, when you have one reasonably close, you may get a real keeper.,I love this camera and it will be part of my birding equipment from now on.,The only minor complaint I have is that it doesn't seem to have an option to recharge the battery using the USB cable, meaning that you have to pack yet another battery charger on a long trip.","January 4, 2014",5.0 out of 5 stars,The Other J.

It has a viewfinder as well as a digital display, making it versatile. Next, its functionality. The zoom capability is UNBELIEVABLE.

B07GPRSYG8,Nikon-Full-Frame-Mirrorless-Camera,Nikon Z6 Full Frame Mirrorless Camera Body,"I was going back and forth and couldn't make up my mind whether I should purchase this camera or not. I needed a camera with good autofocus in video for a new project I'm working on. But I'm a fan of APS-C sensors because I don't see the point in lugging heavy zoom lenses and telephoto primes needed for FF cameras (Nikon's 135mm is 810g and the 85mm is only 350g!  I also prefer the deeper depth of field for video that I get from a crop sensor and even for photos because I hate mushy backgrounds, I'm usually shooting in nice environments and don't want excessive blur. F2.8 in a crop sensor camera is perfect for my style.,I also didn't like the fact that the kit lens included with the Z6 is only 24-70mm. I feel the kit lens should be at least 24-85mm -70mm is simply too short. For video it's not bad as I could change the camera to crop mode, but for shooting close up and outdoor portraits, 85mm is a must have!,Because Nikon does not have a mirrorless crop camera, I tried the Sony a6400 and the IQ was awful in video, (for photo the IQ was pretty nice but the ""best"" standard Sony crop zoom lens, the 16-70mm Zeiss lens is not so sharp...). Besides for the ISO and dynamic range, the video from the a6400 looked pretty much the same as my 1"" sensor camera, the Sony RX10 (in 4k the a6400 was just slightly better). I was considering the Fujifilm XT-3, however after watching many videos comparing the xt-3 to other cameras, I saw that the ISO from Fuji cameras are approximately 1 stop darker than cameras from all other brands. I compared the Sony a6400 and the Nikon d500 (which I currently use primarily for event photography) with the xt-3 at high ISO on dpreview's website with the Fuji set to one stop higher ISO for exposure equivalency. The Fuji xt-3 was pretty noisy compared to the other cameras when used according to real life settings ( one stop higher than the other cameras). And the Z6 against all the crop sensor cameras was amazingly clean! The Z6's sensor is amazing, it is much better at high ISO than the d750 which is only a third stop better than the d500 at high ISO. ( I own the d750 as well and only use it as a backup to the d500).,I decided to go with the Z6 after watching Jared Polin and Max Yuryev's videos comparing autofocus of the Z6 against the a7iii, Canon R and xt-3. From their videos, I found the Nikon autofocus as being on par with the a7iii (and better than the Canon R).,As much as I really wanted a crop sensor camera, I must admit I'm very happy with the Z6. The ergonomics and handling is fantastic, the IQ is amazing, the color science is awesome, and autofocus is totally reliable. I have not downloaded the v2 firmware on the camera to test eye AF but I'm sure it's reliable. The AF is not as good as the a6400, which has absolutely amazing AF, it focuses quickly where it's pointed at, not only if there are faces in the frame. The Z6  focuses wherever it's pointed only in video mode and it's a little slower than the a6400. In photo mode (as well as in video mode,) the Z6 does focus continuously on faces which is why most people want continuous AF for. And of course, whith firmware version 2, it focuses on eyes as well. (i'm not sure if there are other improvements in the speed and focusing with the V2 version.) With the v1 version that is installed on my camera, I find the AF to be totally reliable for my purposes ( I don't shoot wildlife so I'm not an expert in that regard) and I will be using it for professional video purposes. I am excited to download the V2 firmware so I can use eye AF to shoot events and for portraits. I'm very excited for eye AF as I believe it will make my job easier, especially when photographing kids.,I'd take a Z6 over a Sony a7iii any day, certainly over a a6400, regardless if the AF is not that good as the Sony cameras but I do hope Nikon will continue to update the AF.,I was so excited to find that I was able to lock the shutter and focus settings with the fn1 button! Because I move around a lot, I always manage to change settings without realizing it. One of the reasons I love my d500 is the shutter speed and aperture lock and I was extremely happy that it was included with the Z6! Thank you Nikon for that feature!!!,The Z6 is definitely is the most fun camera I ever used and I don't regret purchasing it!,I love everything about this camera, but I really hope Nikon will come out with a crop mirrorless camera AND a 16-80mm, with an f2.8 or at least f4,  KIT lens for it!","June 10, 2019",5.0 out of 5 stars,Chinky
B07GPRSYG8,Nikon-Full-Frame-Mirrorless-Camera,Nikon Z6 Full Frame Mirrorless Camera Body,"So this review is for those wondering how the different piece of the kit fit together and if it makes sense to buy all of this or get things in pieces. I am going to focus on a few little things which I was unable to learn until I got my Z6 Film Maker's Kit.,1) The foam cutout on this kit is for everything minus the gimbal stuff, it is designed to go into a pelican 1520 case, and the cutout for the Atomos Ninja V is a big box-shaped cutout for the entire Ninja V packaging which might honestly be nice since you can repurpose that section as you see fit. The Z6 won't fit in its cutout if you add anything onto it like a bracket or a camera strap.,2) The HDMI cable guard Nikon provides with every Z6 does not work with the HDMI cable which comes with this kit because the HDMI cable plug is too big. (Also as an FYI this is a mini HDMI cable input on the Z6, I had the hardest time confirming this before I got my Z6 in the mail) This is a minor issue but something Nikon should have noticed,3) You will want to get a lot of accessories for the atomos (batteries, SSD, screen protector, SSD to USB C caddy) and a follow focus for the Moza Air 2 gimbal. Probably also a pelican case or backpack for your gimbal for transporting it, thankfully it comes with a foam cutout.,4) The foam cutout for the 24-70 lens is a big box which is snug around the lens hood but not much else, Nikon could have done a better job with this.,5) The magic arms do not hold up the atomos recorder in a straight position with the gimbal no matter how I try. I need to know buy a separate 2nd handle accessory for the moza air 2 for the camera. This is a huge negative which could have been avoided easily in my opinion. I'll probably still use this magic arm for the mic I guess.","March 19, 2019",3.0 out of 5 stars,AZ buyer

Video can be shot in 10 bit N-Log profile with external recorder like Atomos Ninja.,I have got Ninja V recently and its raw footage is just mind blowing after applying LUT's in Premier Pro.,Battery life is also good and I can get around 900 Raw pictures with one full powered battery.,I used my friends Sony A7III before buying z6 and I didn't like the Sony's color,menu & grip much so I bought z6.,Only drawback is z6 has single memory card but its XQD card which is so robust and reliable unlike SD cards which has high failure rate.","July 24, 2019",5.0 out of 5 stars,Sadhana Chhetri
B07GPRSYG8,Nikon-Full-Frame-Mirrorless-Camera,Nikon Z6 Full Frame Mirrorless Camera Body,"This is the best mirrorless full frame camera amongst the 3 big names. I tried all, Nikon is still tops in terms of the ergonomics, the best EVF and also the nice touch screen. The snapbridge is not that bad as some described. Perhaps it has improved so much since the first app. And the new eye focus and focus improvement firmware coming soon will bring the bar higher as evidenced in CP+ demos. And that is Nikon's first full frame mirrorless attempt only !  The Z mount is bigger and better, because the lens is easier to design and sharper right to the corners. The XQD card is just the beginning as it is CFexpress compatible which is 4 times faster write speed.","March 6, 2019",5.0 out of 5 stars,Austin

The battery life isn’t worth complaining about as it’s wise carrying multiples in the first place. The single media slot is on everyone’s list, but I’ve yet to see this as an issue yet. Perhaps I’ll carry a spare card here as well.,I’ve been pouring over the reviews anxiously waiting for this set and it’s finally here.

The mini tripod is easily collapsible.  I liked the SD card storage pouch although one of the pockets was not attached (the thread came loose).  I tried to use the screen protector, but I couldn't get it smoothed out, and I didn't like the bubbles  due to lack of clarity on the screen.  The camera case is just right for the camera and SC card storage, but nothing else.  The BEST part of the package is the Canon camera.

I have a Nikon point and shoot in the car for these times but it went down on me.  I drove to the closest box store and they had this Nikon Coolpix A10.  I like that it takes AA batteries, a dead battery is what caused this problem in the first place, and that it takes SD memory cards.  The color was great and the photos where very sharp.

You will also appreciate Nikon's ergonomics and button layout which, in my opinion, are the best out of any full-frame mirrorless camera. Honestly, go to a camera shop and pick up the Sony, Nikon, and Canon; adjust settings, take a few shots, and see for yourself. Battery life isn't bad either, just make sure to put it in airplane mode when you aren't connected.,XQD cards are great but having to pay $130 for a 64gb card makes me sick.

B07GPRSYG8,Nikon-Full-Frame-Mirrorless-Camera,Nikon Z6 Full Frame Mirrorless Camera Body,"I've been shooting with a D5200 since 2013 and wanted to go fullframe. Was going to buy the D750 in 2017 but video is important to me and I couldn't justify spending $1500 on a body that lacked good video focus and limited me to 1080@60p. So I looked at the Sony a7iii and was about to buy it when the reality of their high lens prices discouraged me. I mean you can get excellent Nikon mount Tamron/Sigma quality lens for significantly less than the cost of an equivalent Sony lens (I got many quality 3rd party Nikon lens for less than $800 while the equivalent Sony is greater than $2000). As great as the Sony a7iii is that sunk it for me...so I decided to wait. Well I'm glad I did as later in 2018 came the Z6 and I bought it as soon as I could. Now 2 months later and several assignments I'm still happy with the Z6.,My main concern was the Z6's compatibility with my Tamron 24-70 2.8 and Tamron 70-300 vr. I'm pleased to report they both work but with some minor nuances. The 24-70 works well except when focusing continuously it looses functionality (screen goes white while it calibrates) for a split second then continues focusing like nothing happened (once every 8 seconds or so as you continuously engage focus). On the other hand the 70-300 performs (see picture of bird at 300mm in tack sharp focus though covered with leaves - cropped to allow pixel peeping) but with the same issue with the addition of a very faint buzzing sound when VR is activated on the lens. Also did a test with a friends Tamron 70-210 f4 and it totally does not work. You get the message ""Error. Press and release shutter button again."" that does not go away after you press and release the shutter.,Did some night shots (FTZ, Tamron 24-70 2.8 A007N, Altura flash unit) at an event and boy I had to work to get focus. Forget auto focus continuous and face detection at night and be prepared for the drudgery of auto focus single and checking to ensure target focus. To be fair focus is about as good as that on my D5200 (though it does not feel as snappy). However, my focusing with the Z6 was really hit or miss at first but when I got use to it my keepers increased.,Don't throw in the towel yet for this wonderful camera. High ISO pictures show much less noise and performs better than many top full frame cameras and you don't have to worry as much about focus calibration issues. Also did a whole night shoot with one half charged battery and it still has 2 bars to spare.,The Z6 feels well built compared to the D5200 and is noticeably heavier (with FTZ adapter on) than my D5200 with a 3rd party grip attached. The informative and excellent EVF, awesome touch LCD, high frame rate with fast clearing bufffer, much lighter than dslr alternative, awesome dynamic range, superb video, etc makes this camera a joy to use.","December 5, 2018",5.0 out of 5 stars,S.

Stabilization, Touch Enabled 3-Inch LCD, Wi-Fi, DC-FZ80K (Black)","Focusing issues are too numerous and too often for my being able to find it acceptable. I am returning the camera. But for the sake of others here is what I have found,The LCD is inadequate and difficult to see when you need it most in direct sunlight as it does not pop out to swivel but for a guy who does most of his photography in bright sunny Florida the viewfinder is my preferred method for completing images.  The viewfinder is bright enough but is of poor quality and considering this has such as large zoom range, having a good EVF is very important. There is the ability to change the brightness of the LCD screen and many users are not aware there is a framing grid overlay grid you can find in the settings so you have a visual horizontal and vertical grid to assist in composition of your shots. ..useful for keeping sunset horizons straight for example.,The camera is speedy in it's startup and focusing time.  The zoom is smooth and increases in just the right increments.  There is no focus assist magnification,  a feature that magnifies a small portion of the focus point to help you visualize detail of that area which is useful when using a long zoom and would've been a very useful tool for a zoom of this magnitude.,Shame I have to return this camera, it felt good in my hands as far as the body grip and I wanted to make it work.","October 23, 2016",2.0 out of 5 stars,electrlux

I carry a Panasonic DMC ZS20 camera in my purse that I use all the time but I also wanted one that had more zoom for when I travel or have my family here or for a hundred and one reasons.  I wanted a camera that would fulfill my desire for great pictures, up close and in the distance, at a reasonable price.  My ZS20 fills my everyday need but this FZ70 does so much more but is too big to carry in my purse.  Of course, there is a lot more to learn about this camera but then it does a lot more than my other cameras.  It is light weight enough to handle with ease and I like the feel of it in my hands.  I do not need a professional camera, just a good camera for my picture taking pleasure.  As far as the bells and whistles, I have not had the chance to go through everything this camera can do as yet but look forward to experimenting in the future.","November 5, 2013",5.0 out of 5 stars,Kindle Customer

The FZ70 is an upgrade for me, having had an FZ40 previously.  Because I never spent much time trying to learn all the features of the FZ40, this camera is almost a whole new experience. Be aware that the manual is not very clear on a lot of the functions of this camera, but there are other sources online for help.,The images (those taken correctly) are clear, and the 60X zoom is fantastic. Some reviewers have stated that image quality is not very good when utilizing the ultra zoom, but I think you will find that with any large zoom if you don't use a tripod.,All in all, I think I will enjoy this camera - even more so after I master all of its functions.  My one disappointment is that the price has dropped considerably since I purchased it last month.","September 11, 2014",5.0 out of 5 stars,JBelgard
B01MRCWQRM,Nikon-26518-COOLPIX-A10,Nikon COOLPIX A10,"I bought this at the big-box retailer with the blue store front and starts with a W. Try as I may, I just am not getting good pictures from this camera. I don't expect super quality, but my dear departed Canon Powershot in the same price range did a far superior job with both clarity, contrast, focus,speed of picture storage, and every other aspect of picture taking.  It is far too late to return it, so it will end up in a drawer somewhere, or I will give it to a child wanting a first camera. I can't recommend this camera.","July 12, 2018",2.0 out of 5 stars,Retired Viking
B01MRCWQRM,Nikon-26518-COOLPIX-A10,Nikon COOLPIX A10,"I ordered this elsewhere because my other digital camera I have been using since 2010 finally kicked the bucket.  I needed something with better megapixels anyhow.  My Canon PowerShot went up to 10MP.  Since this one has 16MP and was very affordable, I decided to give it a whirl.,Great pictures, easy to use, nice features, but one thing that still baffles my mind...NO CABLE!  You mean to tell me for $80+, you couldn't throw in a $5 USB cord?  I'm sorry, but that's awfully cheap of Nikon.  Even my dinky camera from seven years ago included one.  So I had to make, yet, another purchase in order to transfer the pictures onto my PC.  Even though you have a card reader as an alternative solution, I don't know anybody in the world that has one.,I'd also like to mention that, every time you replace the batteries, the darn thing resets back to default, meaning the date and such has to be reprogrammed.  The self-timer doesn't stay.  I have to keep setting it for every single picture.  Again, my last camera didn't do this.  As well, the tripod mount on the bottom is too far to the left, which can cause it to tip over if not balanced correctly.,Overall, it's okay, but come on Nikon, give your customers a cable.  Don't make them go out of their way to purchase something extra for whatever oddball reason you see fit not to include something that's essentially required in order to make full use of your product.","October 22, 2017",3.0 out of 5 stars,Mike C.

I have to admit this is the first really nice camera that I have purchased in several years but it has exceeded my expectations.  The zoom on this camera is impressive.  I was looking for a camera that would take great photos and video, it has exceeded my expectations for both of these requirements.  I was really suprised by the clarity even when using the extended digital zoom.  In the past when I have used the digital zoom on other cameras the picture quality was horrible.  The digital zoom on this camera produces pretty good photos.  I have been playing around with several of the features on this camera but still have a lot to learn.  I think this camera's options will satisfy most users.  If you just want to point and shoot you can always use the automatic settings which produce fantastic pictures.  For the price and quality, this camera is hard to beat.  So far the battery life is great, I have taken several hundred photos (mostly w/o flash) and taken probably an hours worth of video, the battery is still about 1/4-1/2 full.  I would highly recommend this purchase.","November 6, 2013",5.0 out of 5 stars,Dan

This is a bridge camera and not a dslr so with that in mind, this camera for the money is the best you can do.  I have had lots of bridge cameras from all makes (even the Canon SX50 which is a very good camera, but with crazy set up controls and too small), but this one beats them all taking the cost into account.  The zoom is phenomenal especially if you set the camera to 7MP and put it on a tripod.  This zoom should be illegal!!  Or you can shoot at the 16MP and go to 60x and get a great shot.  Sure it has some weak points like no tilting LCD, but every camera has its weak points. IQ clarity is a strength for this camera.  With the price it is selling for on Amazon, I should buy another one.","March 20, 2014",5.0 out of 5 stars,Ben Johnson

Stabilization, Touch Enabled 3-Inch LCD, Wi-Fi, DC-FZ80K (Black)","I have used this camera for almost two years (about 6,000 pictures so far), and I love the camera - especially the 60x optical zoom.  It takes remarkably good pictures in very low light situations, too.,For the last several months though, I have been struggling with a rear dial which has stretches where it ignores rotation (or worse, responds as if I were rotating it in the opposite direction).  As the camera is virtually useless without a functioning rear dial, I was rather disturbed.,Then I remembered I had recently had problems with my computer's mouse. After an internet search, I found that breathing on the mouse button area - getting some humid air inside the mouse - fixed the problem for me.,Having nothing to lose, I tried the same thing this morning with my camera, putting my mouth over the rear dial and exhaling several times to force humid air inside the camera.  Much to my surprise - and relief - it worked.  This sure saved me from having to buy a new camera - at least for now!","February 10, 2016",5.0 out of 5 stars,Alan Darlington

B00HNJWUBI,Sony-DSCW830-Digital-Camera-2-7-Inch,Sony DSCW830 20.1 MP Digital Camera with 2.7-Inch LCD (Silver),"This camera meets all the basics of a compact, budget digital camera.  The pictures were good quality.  My biggest complaint about this camera is the very slow recharge time between taking photos.  Yes, there is a ""burst mode"" to take many pictures in just a few seconds, but this will not use the flash.  When you take a picture, there is a short delay, the picture shows for 10-15 seconds for a review, then a short delay before you can take the next picture.  This is not acceptable to me, but what can I do?  I could not find any settings to change this, could not find any instructions that explained this.,I was not too upset when I dropped the camera in the river and fried it.","August 24, 2014",2.0 out of 5 stars,JP Clark

So pictures are taken at very low Megapixels so they transmit without creating large file sizes. Photo taking action is pretty slow but the pictures seem to come out good.

Since I tend to take a lot of photos indoor with poor illumination, some reviews I've read set my mind towards FZ70 and its 20mm wide.,What I like:,- 20mm wide: it allows me to cover a lot of width without having to step back much. My previous camera has 28mm and other cameras in this range has 24 or 25mm, tipically.,- 1200mm tele: SX50 has the same ammount of tele, but my SX20 maxes at 560mm.,- internal memory: not that I intend to run around without a SD card, but internal memory can be a life saver and it allowed for immediate photos after unpacking, since I didn't bought a new SD card (and my current one was very far).,- easy to open battery compartment: my SX20 has a battery compartment that is a bit tricky to open. On FZ70, you just slide a switch and it opens. Closing is just as easy.,- image quality: my main reason to upgrade. Of course, I fully expected a decent improvement since SX20 is a 2009 camera while FZ70 is 4 years newer. Still, it's quite noticeable when I looked at details while at 100% image size under low light.,What I disliked:,- Fixed lcd: SX20 has a variable angle lcd viewer (so does SX50), while FZ70 has a fixed one. I almost gave up on buying when I saw it didn't have a variable one, since it's so useful for selfies, seeing what is on it when the camera is too high or to low while mount on tripods and such.,- Proprietary USB connector: while most cameras allow USB connection by providing a mini-usb port, Panasonic decided to go with something else and so you're stuck with their cables.,- Battery: it was another factor that almost interfered with this choice. It's mostly personal preference, but I'd prefer if it used 4 AA batteries instead of a proprietary li-ion one. I use Sanyo Eneloops in my SX20 and have been happy with their duration (I can shoot 12h of video without needing to replace them). Also, I could buy some alcalines should necessity arises.,- No lens hood: it's a pity there are no lens hood in the box. My SX20 came with one. It's a cheap piece of plastic that'd be easy and inexpensive for Panasonic to add in the bundle.","December 9, 2013",4.0 out of 5 stars,RodIshiCi

Stabilization, Touch Enabled 3-Inch LCD, Wi-Fi, DC-FZ80K (Black)","I've had this camera for a while now and the thing has been my baby. I love using it, but I have noticed a few flaws as well. It's a cheaper option for superzoom bridge cameras, so keep that in mind while you read about these pros and cons.,Pros:,- cheap for the technology, especially with the high zoom,- excellent 60X zoom,- clear, crisp pictures in good lighting,- fairly durable (mine has taken some hits),- small enough to fit in a backpack without too much worry,- wide angle lens and very good image stabilization,- has a decent viewfinder,- long battery life,- sensitive microphone for picking up audio,- able to have zoom even further increased with a telephoto adapter,Cons:,- the manual focus feature is a joke, it's practically unusable,- forget about manual settings too since it takes too much time to set,- it loves to autofocus on whatever is behind the subject,- the shutter speed is horribly slow (I've missed a ton of birds because of this),- mediocre in color and contrast,- practically useless in low light conditions (especially since you can't connect a remote shutter),- moisture has gotten in and appeared behind the lens on humid days,I still love this camera, but if I could go back in time I'd buy a Sony instead.","September 26, 2017",3.0 out of 5 stars,Logan

If you're looking to purchase a Powershot, I'd recommend checking The Imaging World to buy from.","December 16, 2017",4.0 out of 5 stars,Ren Smith

B00HNJWUBI,Sony-DSCW830-Digital-Camera-2-7-Inch,Sony DSCW830 20.1 MP Digital Camera with 2.7-Inch LCD (Silver),"As a former professional photographer, I was seriously underwhelmed by this camera. For $120, you'd expect something that would, at the very least, produce sharp images. This one doesn't. But there are times when I don't want, or can't, or didn't bring along my big Nikons with all of my interchangeable lenses, filters, lens hoods and tripods; times when I simply want something small, portable to take quick images, to record a place I might want to lug all of my equipment back to, or simply to quickly record an event. Well...I spent a week testing the DSC W830, both indoors and outdoors. I do mostly nature and wildlife photography, not people. I don't need a camera that detects smiles or faces: trees, rocks, mountains, wildflowers, and squirrels don't smile! I just wanted something to take some quick, but sharp images. The autofocus on this camera is less accurate than expected. And though it supposedly focuses at about five centimeters (two inches), this unit did a very poor job. Frankly, the camera in a smartphone can do a better job.","September 14, 2017",2.0 out of 5 stars,Robert

Probably just how I learn better, see one do one kinda thing.

Stabilization, Touch Enabled 3-Inch LCD, Wi-Fi, DC-FZ80K (Black)","My wife and I had been in the market for some time for a high-quality, relatively easy-to-use camera that would be especially great for non-professionals like us who like taking quality travel/nature photos and has good zoom.  We did not want to jump into the DSLR arena, but wanted to get shots as-close-as-possible.  After painstakingly researching media and reviews for all of the latest models in this category, I couldn't pass up the deal on this Lumix FZ70.,I have to say, I feel this camera is one of the best value purchases I've ever made.  First of all, the exterior fit, finish, and feel inspire immediate confidence, as the materials used and weightiness of the device exude quality.  Not chintzy at all.  I tested and compared the Canon SX50 in-store, and while that is also a very capable camera, the Lumix just feels and looks so much more high-quality in person.  Secondly, the ease of use and capability of taking great photos right out of the box, especially in iAuto mode was astonishing.  We were immediately taking awesome photos of our pets up close, and distant birds and squirrels out in the yard on full 60X zoom, with nice bokeh effect and great color and quality.  If the lighting outdoors leaves something to be desired, some of the quick post-processing effects can be implemented to immediately color-up, sharpen, brighten, etc to produce beautiful images with little effort.  Image stabilization is top-notch, as I have been able to take several long-zoom outdoor shots without a tripod with ease, just using simple technique tricks like using the viewfinder while bracing elbows against the body, etc.  Auto-focus is fast and accurate, burst shooting mode is also wonderful, as it greatly increases your odds of getting that perfect shot without any noticeable extra effort on your part.,Although I know there are many reviews that nit-pick on various things such as indoor photo quality, my use of the camera indoors has produced very good results, with a nice flash that doesn't wash out pictures at all.  I feel that for the average user who wants to shoot photos above the capabilities of the average point-and-shoot that appear 'professional' to 95% of viewers, you can't go wrong with this camera.  I have an aging Canon PowerShot SD1100IS small handheld that has taken some amazing photos for me through the last several years, and this Lumix FZ70 with its amazing zoom capabilities is the perfect natural progression to the next level.  At this price point, you can't go wrong.  Highly recommended!","March 20, 2014",5.0 out of 5 stars,Kyle

Did take me some time to work out how to adjust manual exposure and such. The printed manual is very basic but finding some of the settings on the camera is not.  Amazing lens stabilization. I have a hand tremor and can still shoot at full zoom.  From macro to full tele, range is great and picture quality only limited by my talent, or lack thereof, as a photographer.  I don't want to have to haul around multiple lenses, but want to do most of what a full DSLR can do so this is an ideal camera. I'm not sure what the advantage would be of a DSLR.  I got a refurbished one for just over $200, and at that price it was well worth it. Not sure if would have paid full new retail price but even that is cheaper than decent DSLR.

I have been a Leica Camera user for many years, but recently I have more need on the videography side since I started a YouTube channel.  I need a camera that can cover all my need for videos, and a good full frame sensor for me to use with my Leica lenses as well.,Besides the good 4K video capability, the great low light performance really help in many situation.  I no longer looking for expensive zoom lens with f2.8, a f4 lens can pretty much cover all my need for my YouTube video production.  I feel confident to use up to ISO800 and above (I always keep my studio well lit for videos, but for slow motion shots I will need to increase ISO to keep the 180 degree shutter speed).,If you also plan to use Leica M lenses or another vintage lens like me sometimes, I found the 50mm focal length and above works better with adapter.  If you need to 35mm or wider, you might get some vignetting at the corner.

B07B43WPVK,Sony-Full-Frame-Mirrorless-Interchangeable-Lens-ILCE7M3,"Sony a7 III Full-Frame Mirrorless Interchangeable-Lens Camera Optical with 3-Inch LCD, Black (ILCE7M3/B)","At this point, I have had the A7iii for a couple months now and have clicked roughly 3000 images - mainly of family, pets, and my 6 months old babygirl. I can honestly say that these are some of the best images I have ever clicked and that this camera has helped elevate my photography to a whole new level. I would recommend it to anyone in a heartbeat!,A little background and more details...,I had been a dedicated Canon user for 10+ years with 70D (APS-C sensor) for my last camera. Unfortunately that camera had front and back focusing issues even though I had micro-adjusted all my lenses to it. I was so used to clicking 3-4 extra images for those can't-miss moments just to be sure one of them was a keeper.,Earlier this year, I decided to go full-frame and lucky for me, Sony had just announced the A7iii with features that were years ahead of anything Canon/Nikon had to offer at similar price point. After weeks of reading rave reviews from pros and amateurs alike, I pulled the trigger and ordered my A7iii along with the 24-70GM lens. After 2 months of using Sony gear, I couldn't be happier with my move.,Here are a few pros and cons that you may not find in other reviews.,Pros:,- Eye AF:  The hype is real! The Eye AF works (90% of the time) incredibly well and makes it super easy to take portraits. With it on, most pictures are so razor-sharp that I can zoom into the eyes of the subject and find my own reflection. And that's not an exaggeration!,- Excellent Low-light capability:  On my Canon, I rarely pushed past 1000 ISO because of high noise in low-light images. With A7iii, I haven't purchased a flash yet so I am regularly forced to shoot in 10,000 - 12,500 range and the images still looking stunning after processing.,- Less time in post-processing:  Compared to 70D, I find that less of my images need post-processing now and the ones I do have to process take less time.,- File size:  At one point, I was seriously considering the A7(R)iii but now I am glad that I chose this camera. The 50MB files (uncompressed RAW) from this camera already make my 2014 Macbook Pro feel slightly sluggish. Can't imagine what 80-90MB files from A7Riii would have done to my computer.,Cons:,- Sony software is worthless:  the RAW processing software installed 3 different apps - a photo manager, an editor and a remote shooting app. I found the apps a pain to use so ended up uninstalling after the first week and purchased Capture One Pro.,- No built-in flash:  I personally miss having a built-in flash. In most low-light situations, I could take out my 70D from the bag and start snapping in seconds. Currently I don't own an external flash but past experience tells me it will definitely take longer to get snapping when I have to attach an external flash.,With all that said, I still rate this camera 5 stars because of the incredible difference it has already made in my photos.","September 16, 2018",5.0 out of 5 stars,KapilS

This one seemed to fit the bill, but I was surprised because of the price being so low. We used this on a trip to Washington, but also took some pictures around the house. The pictures came out surprisingly well! Each file is about 1 to 2 megabytes in size, and the videos are as long as you take a video. The video was what surprised my daughter the most, who takes tons of pictures. She has a $800 camera, but doesn't always like to take it out while we are walking. She used this one the entire trip and was very happy with it. It is not grainy like some other cameras, and takes very nice pictures. Not blow up 2 wall size quality, but you could blow it up to a small poster and be very happy. Specially if your picture is still. It is a solid camera, and feels like it will stand up. And for the price, you cannot beat it. It does take a SD card and not a micro SD card, but nowadays that is not a problem because they all come with adapters.

Amazon made up for this by offering me a 40% refund to buy a new battery, and the battery was much cheaper than the $31 refund I got so this issue wasn't even reason enough to take a star off. Overall great camera and great customer service from Amazon.I've only owned this for a month and only used it for 2 days for a hiking trip so I can't speak on long term survival of this camera. I will update my review if I have any other issues. Be sure to check for my customer images if you want an idea of the maximum image quality.","February 24, 2019",5.0 out of 5 stars,AmazonCustomer

Though my phone can shoot great photos and videos, I like the appeal of simple point and shoot camera like this one. The image and video quality is decent, it would be foolish to compare it with a DSLR. I guess it works well as an introductory camera for kids. I remember my first digital camera when I was a teenager, it reminded me of those days. Good value when bought with discounts or coupons. I wish it came with a sd card though. This camera made me nostalgic and I am thinking of gifting it to my 10 year old nephew. I think he will love it. Flash is super bright, night mode is bit grainy but okay.  I do not do much digital zoom, but it works. Display is basic and bit laggy, so viewing on desktop would be wiser. Very simple camera, very handy, can have it as a back up or can use it just for fun. Loved the simplistic appeal and nostalgia.","July 26, 2019",5.0 out of 5 stars,Abdullah Imran
B07KSXT9NH,GordVE-Digital-Backpacking-Cameras-Photography,"GordVE 2.7 Inch Digital Camera, HD Camera for Backpacking, Mini Digital Camera Pocket Cameras Digital with Zoom, Compact Cameras for Photography","The description leads you to believe that this isn't a pro level camera and it isn't. However, it does make for an excellent first-time camera for my kids. The focus and flash work very well and while the photos may tend to be a little pixelated if you zoom too much, it's very adequate otherwise. Battery charge holds for a good time. Since the video is 720p, it's not going to provide UHD level quality but the playback suited the kids just fine. Great deal for the features you get.","July 3, 2019",5.0 out of 5 stars,Scott Ernst

I have been looking for this type of leather case for over a year, and finally discovered this one.  The quality is excellent and highly recommend this case for being useful as the daily ""go to"" case.  I am using my camera much more often because this case offers excellent protection and easy portability without the bulk of a bag case.  I do not think I will ever use my old bag case again.

The front piece does have a little extra length to it, but I believe that gives the lens coverage a little more rigidity and ""bump room"" to prevent damage from direct frontal impact. If I have any complaint at all it would be that the strap I received seems narrower and thinner than that shown in the picture. Also, where the picture shows a finished rolled edge to the strap, the one I received was simply a flat, cut edge that's not very comfortable when the weight of the camera is on your bare neck.

Stabilization, Touch Enabled 3-Inch LCD, Wi-Fi, DC-FZ80K (Black)","To fully enjoy the use of this camera,  YOU NEED TO READ THE MANUALS, BOTH OF THEM.  YOU NEED TO DOWNLOAD THE ADVANCED MANUAL AND READ IT.  This camera has amazing capabilities.  The zoom capabilities without reverting to the use of the digital zoom are awe-inspiring.  The Intelligent Zoom is better than a digital zoom, and it extends the zoom capabilities to more than the 60x figure.  I have used both.  The intelligent zoom will give you a photo with fewer megapixels, but the distortion common to digital zooming is missing.  Since you're starting with 16.1 mp, you can well afford to reduce the mp for the purpose of getting a long shot, but you don't even have to do that if you use the zoom attachment you can purchase with the adapter.,I also have the adapter for the zoom attachment and the close-up attachment.  I was using a FZ100, and the same accessories work.  For the record,  you can use the regular zoom AND the intelligent zoom with the telephoto attachment which allows you to get magnificent zoom capabilities without using a digital zoom.,This camera also has good wide angle capabilities as well - at least as wide as I ever want.  It doesn't do fisheye.,It has macrofocusing down to 1 mm AND macro zoom focusing, which is delightful and will enlarge the subject.  And I have the close-up attachment as well, although so far the macro zoom has produced pictures I'm happy with, so I haven't used it.  .,It has many different focusing choices.  You need to see what they are and see which one works for you.  The flexible focus is my favorite.  Uses a bit more battery, but it is faster continuous focus than the one labeled continuous focus.  This is why you have to read the directions.  There is also manual focus.  And standard focus.,They have skimped on not making the vewing screen moveable to different angles.  If you want to take a time exposure, you mght want to use the timed shutter release to avoid camera movement, since there is no input for an external shutter button.  And yes, those things would have been nice, BUT I couldn't afford the camera if they hadn't kept the price down.  This is a hobby of mine, not a profession.,This is one whopper of a camera for the price.  I think they economized in the right places and spent the money on the best kind of image stabilization that you can get - a necessity if you are going to use such a zoom.,I have set my camera to limit the shutter speeds (found in the camera menu settings) so that it can't automatically go to too slow a speed.  Panasonic recommends a tripod -- and it's very true that a good tripod helps - but ninety nine percent of the time, when I want a photo, I either don't have my tripod with me, or it's not set up -- so I am handholding shots that should be on a tripod -- because the deer will leave -- or the birds or small animals are active -- I'm often taking a walk, and I use the zoom to photograph wild flowers I can't get close to without getting into poison ivy or some such thing.,My advice for handheld shots is to use the shutter speed limit, so the shutter speed can't go too slow on you.  I often use shutter priority, risking the shot being too dark, but there is also an option in the setup stuff. Often, even if a picture is too dark, you can improve it with software.,The camera also had editing capabilities, but I use Corel's software on my PC.,I take LOTS OF PHOTOS.  If you think you can't hand hold the camera, snap as many photos as you can, and try.  Hold your breath and get your elbows close to your sides -- really - it steadies you -- or find something to lean on, if possible, and do your best.  Sometimes it doesn't work, but often if I take a lot of photos, at least a couple of them will be sharp, because I snapped the picture at just the right moment.,The beauty of digital photography is that you don't have to pay for your flops.  You can just delete them, and keep the good ones.,This is not a professional photographer's camera, although I would bet that pros would have one whopper of a good time with it.  But I don't have the money to buy a pro's camera, nor do I have the ability to carry the camera equipment I used to -- nor do I have the money to spare for excessive film and processing.,SO I am as happy as a hog in a mud waller with this camera.  It take good pictures.  As with any camera, you need to get used to this particular one.  I have a particular combination of metering and exposure that I usually use -- you could vary your choices to suit yourself, BUT YOU WON'T DO THAT IF YOU DON'T DOWNLOAD THE ADVANCED MANUAL AND READ IT.,I went to the trouble to print out the manual, because I studied it in odd places in order to cover the information.  It is convenient to have it on your computer, too, but I wanted a print out.  I printed it one section at a time.,This is a wonderful camera for the money.  If I could afford the setup the National Geographic photographers use, I wouldn't be able to carry it anyway.  This camera is a great deal of fun, and if you will take the time to master the vast number of choices you have available, you will surely enjoy it.,I highly recommend it.","July 12, 2014",5.0 out of 5 stars,whippersnapper

The default iA setting produces sharp photos and videos, far superior to my Samsung Galaxy 2 (phone), iPhone 4, and assorted cheap 16MP Canon and Nikon cameras. The picture quality is comparable to and possibly even better than from the Canon 16MP D5100 that costs more than twice as much. Some people may be put off by its light weight and plastic body; it feels solid enough for my needs.  The camera works well in low light, occasionally I got a warning to pop open the flash. I simply pressed a button to do that, and viola the flash fired without requiring any setting changes. Because it is light, compact, yields quality results and is not expensive I am likely to pack it on every trip.","March 1, 2014",5.0 out of 5 stars,Chani Pangali

I picked up this kit as a replacement and I could not be happier! The build quality feels great. The EVF and rear screen could be better, but I do not feel that they detract from this camera at all. Battery life is insane, I have been setting this camera up over the past few hours while taking about 200 test shots and I am currently at 99%. In my opinion, the menu system is amazing, I feel that this menu system is better than the Z6 menusystem (again, just my opinion). The autofocus system is literally INSANE, I cannot believe how fast and accurate it is, even in terrible light with a kit lens. I have pretty big hands, so I did need to buy the battery grip for this camera to be comfortable, but having the extra battery is going to be amazing. I have been shooting Canon primarily for the past 10 years and now I see why everyone is jumping ship and moving to Sony. I never thought I would love another camera enough to give up my 5D Mark IV, but this camera is a game changer. I cannot wait to see what Sony has in store for their future cameras and lenses.

B07B43WPVK,Sony-Full-Frame-Mirrorless-Interchangeable-Lens-ILCE7M3,"Sony a7 III Full-Frame Mirrorless Interchangeable-Lens Camera Optical with 3-Inch LCD, Black (ILCE7M3/B)","Coming from Canon background (started with the 10D, latest was the 7D) - I still have my a6000 which is still a truly mindblowing camera (especially for the current price!!) and started to hunger for full-frame with the added benefit of the larger sensor, pixels etc etc when Sony introduced this monster of a camera. It combines everything I hoped into one body - the menu system sucks. The lack of timelapse features sucks (the app store where I bought the time-lapse app which worked great on my a6000 - that store doesn't even exist in the A7 III as of June 3, 2018). Why camera shutter speeds still stop at 30 seconds is way beyond me.... BUT..... the photos from this camera are mind blowing without doing huge editing if you know what you are doing. The sharpness is awesome. The Sigma MC11 allows me to use my 17-40 f4L, 70-200 f4L and other Canon lenses and like others have said, due to the power of this sensor, images are drop dead sharp. There is a bit too much green at times to the images but that's an easy fix if not wanted.,If you are in the market for a full-frame camera, this camera pretty much blows everybody away in the categories that matter: overall noise, sharpness, battery life, video quality (OMG!) and nothing can compete with the size. Holding my 7D in one hand and this in the other, the 7D feels like a bloated dude that needs to loose 30 pounds.,Can's say enough about this camera so I'll let a few images do the talking for me. These are mostly straight out of the camera with minimal post processing. Enjoy if you take the plunge!","June 4, 2018",5.0 out of 5 stars,John Lehmkuhl
B07B43WPVK,Sony-Full-Frame-Mirrorless-Interchangeable-Lens-ILCE7M3,"Sony a7 III Full-Frame Mirrorless Interchangeable-Lens Camera Optical with 3-Inch LCD, Black (ILCE7M3/B)","This Sony A7iii is the best sub 2K full frame camera in the market now.  With more money you can upgrade to ""better"" full frames like a9, a7riii, Nikon z7.. and Canon and Nikon DSLR full frames.  However, if you do not need all those functions then Sony a7iii is the way to go.  FWIW, I tried out the Nikon Z6, Fuji XT-3, Canon 6DMkii (phenomenal deals), and Nikon D850 (was getting a great deal on used).  Eventually, I settled on a7iii.,I upgraded from a Canon 40D which I purchased more than 0 years back.  I did not have too much hardware invested so the move to mirrorless was minimal cost.  I chose the 24-105 G lens vs the kit lens.  It is a lot better and the money is well spent.  I did not choose any GM lenses because I need to get my feet wet using the camera before investing in top notch lenses.,I primarily do social events, travel photography and some sports events.  The camera has great capabilities for that.,The good things about this camera:,1) Resolution is in a sweet spot - not large to slow down the computer,,2) Dynamic range is great, backlit photos come out really well.  Shadows show detail too,,3) Low Light sensitivity:  Photos are very usable till ISO 12800.  I limit the max ISO to that,,4) Autofocus:  Fast, accurate.  Eye AF is something out of the world.  There really is nothing like it on the market from other competitors.,5)  Battery Life:  Really good if you are taking photographs.  But it drains fast and furious if you are taking video.  I would highly recommend buying a second battery and a charger.  Will make your life a lot easier.,6)  Dual Card slots:  I like them a lot.  Use one for video and the other for stills.  I am not too worried about cards getting corrupted or full.  I have 128GB each and those are plenty for a couple of week's worth of travel.,7)  IBIS:  This helps tremendously with camera shake.  Will allow the use of non-stabilized lenses if you find good deals on them.,Cons:,1)  Menu System:  Very exhaustive.  It takes a long time getting used to.  But once you get the hang of the system, it works wonders in customization.,2)  No Charger.  This is way too cheap to not provide for a 2K camera.,3)  Weight:  For all the supposed ""lightness"" of a mirrorless camera, once you add in the lens there is no savings in weight compared with the DSLR.,5)  Sony lenses are heavy and expensive.  Hoping that as the system matures we get more choices.,Overall, a great great camera with very few cons.  There are more detailed reviews on photography websites but I just wanted to give my 2 cents worth on how it works in real life for me.","March 2, 2019",4.0 out of 5 stars,DollarBob

Hoping to stick with Nikon with how much I’ve invested in it over the years,  it was really difficult for me to switch to an all new system especially to the likes of Sony whose lenses are extremely expensive.,The A7III Made it impossible not to convert given all of the features this camera deploys for the price point.  The video and pictures this thing captures simply blows me away as well as the amount of options this camera has.,It does have a few dumb drawbacks and sometimes I feel as if this cameras has been independently designed by multiple people who Never spoke to each other.  But the drawbacks be them as they may  such as the insane menu system is perfectly acceptable to live with given what you get at this price point. I cannot recommend this camera enough and wheras I’m not going into detail in this review, Take it someone who has nearly 30 years of photography experience that this is hands-down the best “hybrid” camera you can get your hands on at this price range period.","May 29, 2018",5.0 out of 5 stars,D New
B07B43WPVK,Sony-Full-Frame-Mirrorless-Interchangeable-Lens-ILCE7M3,"Sony a7 III Full-Frame Mirrorless Interchangeable-Lens Camera Optical with 3-Inch LCD, Black (ILCE7M3/B)","I had my a9 and 3 lenses stolen when my home was broken into. I had planned to purchase the a7iii as a back up to my a9 so decided to pick one up. Don't get me wrong, this is a great camera for the price but having shot with the a9 it just doesn't quite do it for me. Eventually I am selling it off and buying the a9 again. What is missing for me is the focusing. Maybe it's just the copy I have but I don't find the focusing quite as good though don't get me wrong, this camera is a good camera it's just the a9 is the best all around camera you can get in the Sony line in my opinion. I also miss having a choice between the mechanical and electronic shutter. The sensor read out is faster on the a9 so there is just less rolling shutter. After the last upgrades for the Sony cameras I have to say I think the a9 is even better especially regarding eye AF. I have to admit I didn't care for the a9 when I first got it but after awhile I just found myself loving it and now the prices is even lower as of the writing of this review as the price has dropped and the new upgrade for the a9 has made it an even better camera. If you can afford it go for the a9. Having said all that if your budget makes this affordable option this is a great started option and certainly the low light performance is very good. And if you're not shooting sports and have a need for the extra speed of the a9 this is a great option. I have been able to shoot at fairly high ISO and get pretty clean images. The a7iii offers great performance and value. My main con is I don't care for the LCD screen. I feel it could be better and a high resolution but considering the price I guess I can't have everything.","May 16, 2019",4.0 out of 5 stars,Crystal

I miss the little view finder window (or whatever it's called). On this camera you need to use the display window to frame your shot and sometimes in bright light it is nearly impossible to do this. Also I notice that pictures taken with full zoom are not clearly focused even with a solid support of the camera to eliminate shaking. But it works and you don't need to worry about batteries since it is rechargeable. I just used the 1GB card from the old camera and that is enough for 195 pictures set on the highest (""L) setting, or 24 minutes of video (8 minutes of HD video).

And it does fit well.  But I do not agree that you can undo one snap and take a picture.  The case does not easily lift off - it has to lift up and the lens is in the way - maybe you are not supposed to use the lens cap?  Most designs (for other cameras) the snap is at the top of the lens and goes down - also it is just the part covering the lens that goes down.  Here 3/4 of the case lifts up - and then will really be in your way - if you can get it over the lens.  Also the case must be unscrewed to change the battery/memory card - you have to unscrew the case at the bottom - don't expect to do it quickly - if you run out in the middle of something you won't be able to reload before it ends.  I will keep it because it is the only one out there, but doubt I will be using it except when I am not using the camera.","May 1, 2014",3.0 out of 5 stars,tozubri

Stabilization, Touch Enabled 3-Inch LCD, Wi-Fi, DC-FZ80K (Black)","I bought this camera for the zoom range, and I am very pleased with that aspect. However, a couple of other things could be improved. For example, the burst rate/buffering is pretty limited. Rapid fire shots (like I am used to doing with my DMC-FZ200) are limited to 2-3 and then there's a substantial wait until the buffer is flushed to the disk. This effectively forces me to be very selective about when I push the release button, especially when I'm shooting action scenes. Another issue is the fixed monitor screen, which isn't much help when the camera is pointed at the sky. Again, I'm spoiled, I suppose, by the FZ200's rotating display. Another surprise came when I tried to take some long exposure night sky shots and found that the camera controls the limits on ISO and shutter speed. This was in P mode, so I need to do some more experimentation before I give up on using it for these sorts of shots.","October 18, 2013",4.0 out of 5 stars,R. Simpson

Stabilization, Touch Enabled 3-Inch LCD, Wi-Fi, DC-FZ80K (Black)","Great camera, not a direct competitor to the P900 but definitely faster processing and better all around capabilities. With a teleconverter you can get out to P900 range but you have to use a tripod. The image stabilization is far less capable than Nikon's. The android app is particularly useful when using a tripod, even allowing for control of focus. It puts the Nikon app to shame.,The best teleconverter I've found is the Olympus B-300 1.7x which can be found on ebay. Its lightweight enough that it can be attached directly to the lens without using an adapter. Just understand that your image stabilization doesn't work when you do that, and you'll need to use a tripod.

Stabilization, Touch Enabled 3-Inch LCD, Wi-Fi, DC-FZ80K (Black)","Pretty nice camera and overall I'm satisfied, but I do have a gripe or two.  The major criticism I have thus far is that the writing on the buttons is already wearing off, despite treating the camera gingerly.  I've had the camera less than 3 months and one button is illegible already.  Very disappointed with that aspect.  Also, soon after my purchase, the lens cap fell apart while attaching it.  One of the tiny springs shot out, never to be found, so the cap no longer stays on the lens.  I've never had similar problems with my Nikon and Canon products.,EDIT:  10/6  - I have to lower my rating again at this point.  The sticker trim that's around the lens has begun pealing off.  I've not even used the camera in a few weeks.  Took it out of its case and it's hanging off.  Can't be ""stuck"" back on readily.  I think Panasonic really cut corners on the fit and finish of this camera.  Although the image quality is very good, at this point I'm starting to regret my purchase because I'm not confident the thing will hold together over time.","September 15, 2017",2.0 out of 5 stars,WD2015

They were small and great price and took incredible photos. I avoided buying a DSLR just because they took such good photos. So when I saw this Lumix FZ70, I thought wow, this is going to be a great camera. I didn't like the larger size, but it sounded like it would have such great options and who could pass up that 60X zoom! Sadly, I have been disappointed. In fact I was taking photos at an event with this new camera, and the action photos were so bad, I ended up pulling out my little Lumix DMC-ZS25 and used it to take my photos. We read through the big on-line manual to see how we could take better photos, but to no avail. Absolutely cannot take action shots with this camera. The subjects are always out of focus. The IA setting was useless. We even went to the manual settings, trying every combination, but again no luck. I had bought this to take action shots of dogs running in agility competition. My little Lumix ZS25 camera did such a great job but got dust on the sensor and it would cost more than the price of the camera to fix. So we bought this one as a replacement and sorry we did. Can't return it because the instructions say you can only return unopened products. Of course we opened it. We used it.

B07B43WPVK,Sony-Full-Frame-Mirrorless-Interchangeable-Lens-ILCE7M3,"Sony a7 III Full-Frame Mirrorless Interchangeable-Lens Camera Optical with 3-Inch LCD, Black (ILCE7M3/B)","Bad for wireless transfer to phones, iPads, or computers. Great for focus clarity.,Worst Con: NON-FUNCTIONING WIRELESS FILE TRANSFER (both WiFi/NFC) due to Sony software and App upgrades.,Best Pro: All the accolades about sharpness of focus are true. Perfect for those who rarely use manual mode.,I bought this as a travel camera and as backup to my Canon 5D MIII camera. This has longer batter life (no AA batteries) and full frame. Wanted the ease of use with wireless on-the-go file transfer to iPhone/iPad. The mandatory Sony Playmemories app gets 1 Star for being made useless by Sony. Can’t log in. Cryptic menus before they bricked the app. One app controls the Sony cameras for file transfers. Not working with all Sony models. I’ve ordered an SD card reader to Apple lightning connector to, hopefully,  get my pics to my iPad. Maybe, at least I can share with social media sites and friends/family. Casts a dark shadow on such a great camera!,Background:,I’ve used Canon cameras and lens for many years. They have gotten less usage due to the heavy weight of the setup and my aging joints. I collect antique and modern day cameras. So, this is not my first Sony or first mirrorless camera. This is my first Sony alpha line camera.","May 7, 2019",3.0 out of 5 stars,H. Mera
B07B43WPVK,Sony-Full-Frame-Mirrorless-Interchangeable-Lens-ILCE7M3,"Sony a7 III Full-Frame Mirrorless Interchangeable-Lens Camera Optical with 3-Inch LCD, Black (ILCE7M3/B)","There are a lot of excellent reviews on the technical side of this great camera, so I will not go there.  Instead, I will just share some personal experience playing around with it in the past week.  I bought the camera with the 28-70mm kit lens.  From Costco, I bought two 128GB Sandisk Extreme SD cards and put them in.  Alas, slot 1 could not read it while slot 2 can.  Switching the cards gave the same outcome, so it is not likely the cards’ problem.  And my a6000 could read the cards.  Searching on internet showed that this is a common problem for a7iii with 128GB cards.  So I had to two PNY 32GB cards on hand.,The camera is light weight, which I really like.  Coming from Pentax K-1 with 24-70mm Pentax lens and 70-200mm Tamron, I can really appreciate the portability.  For ergonomics, I have to say that the grip feels more comfortable with the K-1 because I have large hands - the AF-on button falls naturally under my thumb (I use back button focusing all the time), and the front and back dials are easy to control.  On the contrary, since the a7iii has a smaller footprint, I found my thumb sometimes has to “hunt” for the AF-on button, and the front dial is not easy to operate.  After a few tries, I am used now to the setting and feel more confident with all the control buttons and dials.,I have not tried the high speed multi-frame shooting for fast moving objects (sports, birds, etc.), so cannot say how good the a7iii is compared to my 7Dii (both have 10 fps I believe); besides, my kit lens on the a7iii lacks the range and power of the 100-400mm II on the 7Dii, so I will leave opinions on that to a later time.  Btw, the 7Dii has also a better grip in my hand.,Back to the grip - comparing the a7iii with the a6000, the a6000 feels surprisingly better because it does not have the groove and I don’t need to do BBF (no AF-on button).,Overall, I love my a7iii so far and will put a lot of good use to it once I have some decent glass (my eyes are on the 24-240mm for travel, and some GM or Tamron for local use).","October 19, 2018",5.0 out of 5 stars,Starkid
B07B43WPVK,Sony-Full-Frame-Mirrorless-Interchangeable-Lens-ILCE7M3,"Sony a7 III Full-Frame Mirrorless Interchangeable-Lens Camera Optical with 3-Inch LCD, Black (ILCE7M3/B)","Thank you Sony for developing this insane beast of camera. This is such a powerful tool at the disposal of the photographer. Absolutely insane dynamic range... so much so, even Lightroom sliders can’t keep up. Insanely good high ISO quality. You can’t tell the difference between 100 ISO and 1000 ISO. Huge flexibility. Eye autofocus is perfect. Fast. Responsive. Beautiful images from this camera. Blows my old a6000 out of the water.

B07B43WPVK,Sony-Full-Frame-Mirrorless-Interchangeable-Lens-ILCE7M3,"Sony a7 III Full-Frame Mirrorless Interchangeable-Lens Camera Optical with 3-Inch LCD, Black (ILCE7M3/B)","I have been a Canon user for many years and I was skeptical buying this camera. When looking at this camera on paper the specs are amazing for the price. Canon would charge at least $800-$1000 for the same specs.,So I bought this camera and figured I would use it along my Canon and adapt my Canon glass. I did purchase the camera with the kit lens so I could compare my adapted Canon lenses with the native Sony lens. Well, getting use to the new system did take  a few days of learning the menu system and customizing all the programmable buttons how I wanted them. Sony gives the user so many ways to customize the camera it took some getting use to. Canon does not give the user that much freedom.,I used the MC-11 adapter to use my Canon glass on the Sony which worked good for photography but video auto focus was a struggle. After using the Sony A7III for a few weeks I was impressed with the system so much that I decided to make the switch to Sony. I have been waiting for Canon to improve their video features but I have waited long enough so I sold my Canon glass and bought Sony native glass including the Tamron 28-75 F2.8 E-mount which is an amazing lens that is much sharper than any lens that I have ever owned. Yes even sharper then my Canon 70-200 IS II 2.8. I no longer need to add sharpening in post which is great.,The Sony A7III a great all around camera with so many great features. Some of the features that I appreciate the most are the 4k full frame video, 1080p @ 120p, the electronic viewfinder which shows you your exposure in real time (amazing and a game changer), 10 frames per second shooting great for sports or wild life, 15 stops of dynamic range, fast auto focus, eye auto focus, and hundreds of autofocus points that cover most of the frame.,Sony has legacy of not holding back when it comes to their cameras which is the opposite of Nikon and Canon and I hope that their history of innovation will continue.,For me this camera meets all of my needs at a great price. There is no perfect camera but right now this comes pretty close. When I use this camera it makes me want to shoot more and it gives me the tools that help me create. From a Canon user with no regrets.","September 29, 2018",5.0 out of 5 stars,Sam Bartaluzzi
B07B43WPVK,Sony-Full-Frame-Mirrorless-Interchangeable-Lens-ILCE7M3,"Sony a7 III Full-Frame Mirrorless Interchangeable-Lens Camera Optical with 3-Inch LCD, Black (ILCE7M3/B)","Switching from Canon EOS 6D, the first thing I noticed is the dynamic range! I updated to the firmware version 2.1.0 and my Canon EF 85mm f/1.8 USM and Canon EF 135mm f/2L USM performs flawlessly wide open with the Sigma MC-11 adapter! Even I can confirm that my Tamron SP 15-30mm Di VC USD G1 lens performs and focuses perfectly with the Sigma adapter. Therefore, I don't have to buy native Sony lenses for now. However, given that the Tamron 28-75mm f/2.8 Di III RXD is so good, I added it to my set up and I am blown away by the quality I am getting!,Coming from one cross-point autofocus and focus & recompose technique, using the flexible point autofocus with joystick works amazingly for me. AF-C is better than AF-S. Eye AF is awesome and it performs very well in dark situations such as taking portraits in Christmas lights without using any flash! And then during editing, shadows can be recovered really well! But I found the auto white balance a little bit off from the real world when I took the picture. So it takes a while to adjust during post-processing. Well, I shoot uncompressed RAW to have the freedom to make any adjustment, so I ain't complaining.,Of course, Canon EOS 6D is a good-old sensor and has old specs, it cannot be compared with the A7III. But for $2000, I can't justify getting even the EOS R (was being sold for $1900 on eBay for a while) when this camera performs so well with the Sigma MC-11 adapter on the Canon lenses with IBIS! I am confidently saying that Canon lenses are sharper on A7III than on Canon 6D. I calibrated and micro-adjusted all the lenses on 6D so they were sharp. But on A7III, they are sharper!,I am more inclined to travel and landscape photography, so I added extra battery and L-bracket. Amazingly enough, in this freezing winter, I didn't need second battery during 4 hours of outing! And while the L-bracket helps as a tripod mount, it also guards the edges of the camera and provides support for the pinkie. It also protects the battery door from snow and water! Therefore, I keep it on my camera all the time, except while changing the battery.,The menu is broad compared to Canon. But I am okay with it. I customized the buttons watching the Youtube reviews and it is becoming muscle memory after every usage.,After using Canon EOS 60D and 6D, I waited to switch to mirrorless. As Sony has progressed so far while Canon is catching up, I will keep using this awesome camera for the time being and expecting better techs from Canon. Third party lenses are so good nowadays that as a consumer, you cannot go wrong if you change systems!,I took it out during heavy snowfall on Christmas night and it did not show any warning at all! So I confirm its weather-resistance. I have added a picture here to say it all!","December 29, 2018",5.0 out of 5 stars,ASM
B07B43WPVK,Sony-Full-Frame-Mirrorless-Interchangeable-Lens-ILCE7M3,"Sony a7 III Full-Frame Mirrorless Interchangeable-Lens Camera Optical with 3-Inch LCD, Black (ILCE7M3/B)","I've only had the camera a few days, but I'm excited to really test this out.  My other camera is an a6000, so having a stabilizer for all of my vintage lenses is wonderful.  The math is easier without a crop factor on the focal distance.  The image quality is wonderful.  I'm not sure if it's any sharper, but seems to do better in different lighting conditions.  As far as with my old film lenses, the images look much better, not as cropped.  My 135 f2 looks like a portrait lens instead of a telephoto again.,The menu system is much more substantial.  There are about 30 or so pages of menus.  Do not let this overwhelm you!  Sit down and watch a YouTube video on it for 20 minutes and you'll have it dialed in.  If you already own a Sony Alpha model, it works the same, but there's more options.,The body size isn't really any larger than the a6000, but it does weigh a bit more.  The handling is great!  I missed the front and rear scroll wheels that I had on the old Canon 50D.  It's a much more simple process when you are in Manual mode.  There are also 4 custom buttons, 2 more than the a6000.  And of course most buttons are programable to however you'd like.","June 21, 2018",5.0 out of 5 stars,Jason Blackman

I've been a longtime fan of canon rebel SLR. I was worried the digital model wouldn't live up to its predecessor. My worries were unfounded. Everything about this camera is wonderful. Easy to figure out (even for an old lady like me). I recommend spending several days with the camera just trying out all the features and functions before using it for an important event, because there are so many enhancements and possibilities. You COULD just put it on auto and get fantastic pictures, but then what would be the point of buying a camera with so many great features? The lenses included in this bundle are all great. The 500mm, I didn't think I'd use, but it's been so fun taking pics of the moon. It takes time to get used to the light balance if you are used to film cameras, so practice with it if that's how you started. If you started on digital cameras, you won't have any problems. The camera bag is too small to hold everything that comes with it, so if you want to take everything with you, get a bigger bag. The bag isn't waterproof, either. Just water resistant. So a good, large, waterproof camera bag is a good additional purchase. You can't go wrong with this bundle. I was so nervous buying something this expensive online, but I'm so happy I bought it.Included a few photos I've taken with it since buying it in June. The moon is with 500mm lens, manual setting w/250 shutter speed (on tripod using the included shutter cord/button). The other pics are in Colorado.","July 23, 2018",5.0 out of 5 stars,Elizabeth Bonecher-Brenaman

I've been shopping around for this type of camera and lenses for quite some time so I knew what I wanted and the average price. Let me say, it was way more than this. AND here I got lots of accessories that I wouldn't have gotten at a store. I am not a professional photographer, just an amateur that wants to mess with it and learn. I've used a camera like this with my work so I am familiar with it and this one met all my expectations. I have not tried the very large lens yet but the two Cannon lenses work great. I also have not tried the flash that came with it yet. I'm delighted to have a mono-pole but will use a regular tripod, which I already have, when using the longest lens. I do have to say the bag that came with this stuff is a bit cheap feeling. I quickly ditched that and got a backpack to transport everything.","June 7, 2018",5.0 out of 5 stars,michs

Loved that camera!!! Then I bought an SX40 and loved that camera and last year decided on something stronger - the SX60. For some reason I couldn't get a feeling for that one. Then I saw the T6 w/the 500mm lens.  Almost identical to the XTi - only digital. Bought it on Black Friday, had it Saturday. I couldn't have asked for better packaging with the camera and one lens wrapped with bubble wrap. The 75-300 was in a box of it own and packed so it wouldn't bounce around. The whole bundle was packed very securely. Tried the camera and lenses and all worked as it should. I can see an affair coming already with this camera.

I bought this one for my 7 y.o daughter, she's obsessed with taking pictures. Before we bought this camera she would take my phohe and keep it for hours, taking 100+ puctires of her thumbs or nose. It was supper annoying for me, especially I need to work from my phone sometimes and couldn't find it anywhere. Finaly my patience has broken and I got this camera. What can I say, hurray, finaly nobody touches my phone. She loves it, she takes pictures of EVERYTHING! But to tell the truth quality of the camera is not bad at all, colors are great, not grainy, even in low light environments. There's very simple menu, lots of stickers you can add to the pictures before you take a shot. You can record a video. Camera comes very well packed, the kit includes: camera itselt, USB charger, flash card for 16GB, special adaptor for conputer, manual and neckband.,The camers is very easy to use. It has impressive battery life, since we got it we haven't even changed ot yet. And it's more the a week.

Stabilization, Touch Enabled 3-Inch LCD, Wi-Fi, DC-FZ80K (Black)","I wanted a super zoom bridge camera because I take a lot of bird photos but couldn't justify the cost of upgrading to a DSLR right now.  Before I bought the LUMIX, I had been using a Fujifilm SL300, which I loved but which didn't quite have the power I wanted at 30x zoom.  The Panasonic camera has mostly met my expectations, with clear optics for the zoom (with a tripod, of course) and options for manual settings that allow me to tweak my shots.  The Intelligent Auto setting is surprisingly good in selecting the correct settings for the scene you're shooting, although it doesn't always give me what I want, hence the need for the manual settings.  With a 60x optical zoom and macro lens settings, this camera gives me both power and versatility.,Some reviewers have mentioned how big it is, and because I couldn't find it in stores, I was nervous.  I was relieved to discover that it's NOT big for a bridge camera, only in comparison to a point-and-shoot.  The LUMIX is the same size as my Fujifilm, just with a wider lens.  There's a bump out on the right for gripping with a nice area for my thumb on the back of the case -- we lefties have always had to adjust for a mostly righty world, and I have no issue holding the camera with my right hand.  I'm not going to stash this inside of a handbag, but then again, I didn't expect to.  When I'm using this, I wear it around my neck or over my shoulder.,The LUMIX has too many features to include in a customer review; however, several of them are worth noting, especially for those who want to use this as more than a point-and-shoot:  manual settings for aperture and shutter speed; the ability to program shift; focus locking; the option to switch from LED screen to traditional viewfinder; pop-up flash; shoe for separate flash; continuous (""burst"") shooting mode, with or without autofocus, up to nine shots.  Point-and-shooters will be familiar with the scene options, and, of course, the camera also takes video, although I never use it for that.  I also never use the ""creative control"" feature since, if I really wanted special effects, I'd do it on my computer, not with the camera itself.  Although anyone can pick up and use this camera, it takes some practice to get used to the settings and features for a more enhanced photography experience.  Don't expect the LUMIX DMC-FZ70 to equal a DSLR, but do expect it to be much better than a point-and-shoot.  My only disappointment, and hence the half-star deduction, is the inability to use a remote shutter.  Most people won't care about this; however, for bird photography, I could really use it at times.,The camera comes with a battery (buy a spare!), a wall charger, a lens cap, and a neck strap.  You'll have to buy a case if you want to protect it and don't already have one.  And don't forget the memory card.,In comparison to the Fujifilm I already owned, the Panasonic is almost interchangeable except for the zoom power.  Both are excellent bridge cameras with roughly the same size and features.  The stability feature on the Panasonic might be slightly better, and it includes a few extra options; however, I consider them to be comparable cameras.  The real issue is deciding on the maximum optical zoom power and whether you need it.,-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann","August 6, 2015",5.0 out of 5 stars,Debbie Lee Wesselmann

Works great for her. Images are not great but she doesn't care. If you are looking for quality pictures you want to get something better but just for fun and so a kid can see what they take pictures of it's fine. Images tend to be dark and overexposed. Changing the sharpness to soft made them easier to look at. For the most part they are clear. Zoom gets a pretty blurry.

I was very pleased with how easy it was to use this camera and loved the pictures it took.  I do have some trouble using the telescope lens, and they do offer other packages so if that's something you don't need, you may want to chose a package with a different lens.  I use this camera all the time living in the woods for wildlife pictures and they are professional quality.  It did come with a lot of extras and I haven't used some of them.  However, I shopped around for this specific camera and this price couldn't be beat.  I even went to a store to look at this exact camera before purchasing and the store's price just for the camera and a small lens was more than this whole package.

It has settings for different types of picture types. My camera is generally set on sports mode, but I have taken portrait photos and landscape photos. The bundle comes with light filters and screens, which allow you to control the amount of light coming into the lens. This is awesome for Friday Night Lights photos. I also love the two different lenses that come in the bundle. They make taking photos super easy based on your distance from the subject and how up close and personal you want to be. If you are a manual reader as I am, you can make your photos even crisper by adjusting the shutter speed. This is accomplished by knowing which small dial to turn. The autofocus feature is also nice.

I feel like you don’t need the huge telescope lens unless you are going to take picture of the moon or lions from far. The bag it comes with are okay and so are the filter. The reason I’m giving 3 star review is because the little tripod broke on me and I email them just to get a reply a week later. The monopod is pretty bad.

Sometimes it makes all the sounds of snapping a photo but then you go to look at how it turned out and there is no photo.,I have a lot of experience with 35mm film SLR cameras and so it didn’t take long to learn to use the manual options.

It's exactly like the pictures given- the casing is smooth, the pink is very pastel and beautiful, and the yellow is just as pastel and bright. The camera feels very lightweight and it's quite small compared to regular cameras, but then again it would be perfect for young children to play with. It feels sort of plasticy but it's a very nice texture. I didn't quite understand what it meant by stickers, but when I tried it, to me it was more like filters (like those on Snapchat, Facebook messenger, or Instagram). The only difference from these camera filters and the social media filters is that the camera can't match up to your face. The sticker/filter is in a set location and you have to match it up to the person or thing you are taking a picture off. The camera is really easy to use and I love how there is a memory card included. My niece will definitely love this for sure. It'll be a great toy for any children that loves to take pictures of things and wants to have a camera of their own. Although I do wish there were other colors since not all kids like pastel pink. Definitely recommend though.","July 8, 2019",5.0 out of 5 stars,Sharon

I always loved photography, and I have been using all kinds of different types of smartphone and tablets for taking pictures. While lots of those handheld mobile devices did very good at taking pictures, this it DSC-W800 beats all the smartphone and tablet cameras especially with the image processing like (exposure etc.) Also the 5x Optical Zoom is awesome lots of smartphone cameras don't have any Optical Zoom and the ones that do are very limited on the distance because of the focal length. Most new high end smartphone cameras have 1x-2x Optical Zoom which is barely noticeable. And digital zoom just sucks. So coming from tablets and smartphone cameras I have to say this is my best first digital camera I have ever had! The camera has auto focus, 5x Optical Zoom, has a proprietary USB cable for data transfer and changing. The pictures are very good which I will attach in this review.","February 24, 2019",5.0 out of 5 stars,AmazonCustomer

There are so many features that I will have to study the manual for a while to know how to use them all. I can hardly wait to take this camera on my next trip. I should get some amazing nature pictures. Zoom is 60x for optical and another 60x for digital (120x). Wide angle is 20 mm and it zooms out to 1200mm at full extension. I looked at various cameras with a mega zoom feature including the Canon SX50. This Lumix has most of the features of the Canon as well as a few extra, a larger optical zoom (60x as opposed to 50x on the Canon) and is priced about $35 less than the Canon. I am very happy with my purchase.","December 5, 2013",5.0 out of 5 stars,DLR

But, he's taken some really great images at full zoom and it's always surprising how close he can get.  It's lightweight and small enough to carry around all day; all the other buttons & functions are easy to find and similar to our other camera.  Not top of the line, but definitely a good value.

The camera I am using now is a T5i so nothing professional.,What I like about the Sony:,The camera feels sturdy and heavy like the old 35mm film cameras of the good ol days. I loved that feel.,The sensor is huge compared to the one in my Canon T5I.,The autofocus, Adapted with a Metabones V, was incredibly fast on my 50mm 1.8.,The bokeh was amazing.,WhatI didn’t like about the A7III:,Coming from a past of Canon’s cameras, this camera feels like a point and shoot. The doors that cover the usb and external mic is so flimsy it feels wrong for a $2K camera. Even the door that holds the SD cards or the battery feel very flimsy. My T5I, a $400 camera, feels much more rugged.,No battery charger. Are you serious, Sony?,That is all I can say this far. In short, eithrr my canera or my metabones adapter were difective and, once I took the metabones off the canera, the lens contacts on the camer body were broken. Like, 2 were completely cut off and 2 were bent. So, I am getting a replacement of both items and will update the review then.","August 31, 2018",3.0 out of 5 stars,Piko

We have a GoPro but the fish eye angle drives me crazy sometimes. This is a camera I would give my kids to play around with. But when it comes to me recording stuff in our lives, I’ll spend a few more hundred to get better quality.,First, the internal mic is AWFUL. It picks up every little shift in the camera itself. It ends up sounding like creaking and crackling noises. And then even at arm’s length I could barely hear what I was saying.,Second, it wasn’t as intuitive to use. I consider myself decently tech-savvy, but I had to use the user guide multiple times.,Third, I was not impressed with the photo quality. Super grainy no matter how I messed with the settings.,I’m not sure if I just got a dud, but I’ve noticed the same photo being used for other listings on here.

Love the features of this Nikon Coolpix B500.  I'm not a camera person but I love to take pix, and this works very well.  It's like a step above a point-and-click, but with a wonderful lens that can zoom in tight.  I bought this for my husband's birthday because he liked my other one so much that I figured he should have his own.  (not that I don't mind sharing, but when we're together and trying to take pix, seems to me that we should not have to wait our turn to use this great camera),I was particularly impressed with the whole bundle from this seller.  There are so many great accessories included that aren't normally with a camera purchase.  The bag is a really good camera bag that adjusts to hold virtually anything you'd need.  Love that they included both a large spider tripod and a short tripod.  Plus, they sent a 64gb memory card which was a very nice touch.

I have been using Fuji for about 15 years and I switched to Nikon for a change. It contained most of the basic features as my Fuji except the eye lens. Please note: You are only able to take a picture using the display. If you need to see extreme detail, this may frustrate you. With a 40x zoom, you need an eye lens. I used the camera for about a week and a half. The image quality  is terrible and every image on a regular/auto setting is thoroughly washed out. If you utilize the dawn/dusk or sunset setting it drops a blue cast over the image which in some cases looks ridiculous, but without it, it would be too bright. There is no definition or depth to the images. It seem to me I get either washed out/unremarkable images or blue images. Glare is hard to avoid as well even with a darker setting. You don't see this glare until you download the larger image. I have provided images side by side. From L to R is a cell phone image, one on Auto and one on Dawn/Dusk. At least the cell image has no glare. An everyday user for everyday life, this is fine. Other than that, it has no use. It is my opinion that the reviews posted are fictitious. There is simply no way I could be getting these pictures based on REAL reviews. It doesn't make sense.","March 13, 2019",1.0 out of 5 stars,Carol A. Corsaro

This is a great camera for amateur photographers.  It is true to the advertisement.  It is a lot smaller than I expected, but I appreciate that it will be easier to slip into a purse when I travel.  Very comfortable to hold and use.  Straightforward features.  I would say the shutter (if that is the right word) is very slow.  So if you are setting up for a sudden photo op, you might miss it.  That is the reason I cannot give it five stars.  Also, I had a great customer service experience with Beach Camera.  Initially, when I got the camera, there was a defective European battery charger in the box, and for many reasons, it would be no good for a U.S. based customer.  Also, the batteries had already corroded.  It could be argued that someone should have caught it, but I understand mistakes happen.  I appreciate just how quickly they resolved the problem.

Wish I had not bought this. Very disappointed in this Nikon. Enough so that my next purchase will be another brand altogether. *********This purchase was to replace my NikonCoolpix P510. Had that one for several years and finally the abuse caught up with it. I actually feel like I took a step down with this new camera. But, I have not used it a great deal yet so perhaps my opinion will change. I shot some video at a dog agility trial, even in good sun there was a bit of blur when I zoomed. One negative of note, the usb cable to allow me to upload directly to my pc is RIDICULOUSLY short. Too damn bad the usb cable from my old Nikon won't work with the new one. This camera is OK.

All I had to do with the zoom then was focus the end of it. Well treacherous crystal clear shots, zoom gets me closer to the critters, and the negation gets me crater shots of the moon.

B00I8BIBCW,Sony-DSCW800-Digital-Camera-Black,Sony DSCW800/B 20.1 MP Digital Camera (Black),"After reading the positive reviews and seeing the price, I decided to purchase this camera for a trip. It's very easy to use out of the box. Simply install the battery and your memory card and start using. The memory card is sold separately. As an amateur photographer, I loved how easy it was to snap pictures. All you have to do is aim and press the button. I was also impressed with the battery. My first digital camera was a Kodak that required Double-A's, which ran down very quickly. I used over three dozen batteries on that trip, which wasn't cheap. That wasn't the case with the battery. I never once had to recharge it during my 1.5 week trip. The reason I give it three stars is because of the picture quality and the screen. The screen was hard to view in a variety of lights because it was dim. The picture quality was too light, and some of them came out soft and blurry, even when I was standing still. That said, I managed to get some good shots that I was able to improve with Photoshop. I love the compact design, which is perfect for traveling.","August 3, 2014",3.0 out of 5 stars,Deborah Woehr

I think I set my expectations a little too high though. The camera itself is nicely made; light and small enough to fit in my tiny woman hands. But i wouldn't call this a professional camera. It takes quality pictures most of the time but sometimes I feel as if I NEED a tripod to take second pictures. Especially if the lighting isn't perfect or its dark out. I've taken beautiful close up pictures of full moons with this camera and it's given me plenty of stunning pictures for my cousins wedding. But when I have tried to take far away night shots, you definitely need a steady hand because it doesn't seem to focus nearly as well as during the day. It's a nice little camera for beginners but I wouldn't recommend for someone who's trying to do photo shoots.

B07B43WPVK,Sony-Full-Frame-Mirrorless-Interchangeable-Lens-ILCE7M3,"Sony a7 III Full-Frame Mirrorless Interchangeable-Lens Camera Optical with 3-Inch LCD, Black (ILCE7M3/B)","There are or soon will be many reviews on this breakthrough camera by experienced and trusted camera experts. There will also be countless opinions stated on these pages by actual users, by people who have never seen one and will never see one, and also by advocates of other brands and systems whose opinion is driven by brand loyalty rather than the merits and flaws of this brand’s products. Me, I am an a7 series owner who is a career photojournalist, who uses this series as a bridge between true pro gear (which this is not by any stretch) and consumer/enthusiast models, most of which these days are still DSLR small(er) sensor models.,Always remember that unless it says ""Verified Purchase"" opinions are not likely not based on real hands-on testing by someone who has bought an actual a7 III and at this time they are in very tight supply with a wait of a couple of months. It will take a long time before someone receives a working production model and spends enough time with it to make any valid performance claims, either positive or negative. As a working professional photographer I had the opportunity to spend enough hands on shooting time with the a7 III to get a good feel for it and compare it to my own a7 series. Of course none of the advance user impressions prior to the final release and delivery of the product in spring 2018 carry much meaning as they are most conjecture and opinions. So rather than dwell on so-called test images or camera specs, which by now have been well published and documented by established trusted sources, I will just add some real life observations and hopefully guidelines that can help you with your decision making process.,Unusual for me I won’t detail every spec and what it means and how it works because I believe someone who is shopping for a camera of this sophistication level is savvy enough to know those things and where to find them. And I won’t bore you with sample photos that are meaningless unless you know all of the EXIF specifics and even more importantly, what post processing the shooter applied to their photos. I did include a couple but please consider them for what they are, merely examples, not proof of anything.,Therefore I’ll keep this short and focus on a handful of missed opportunities that I feel strongly about:,1. The lack of an external, dedicated on-body manual switch (like on the a9) for auto/manual focus is missed on a camera in this category.  This should not be a premium feature, that is a mandatory feature of any camera above the point and shoot range.,2. Realizing that Sony already has that fine a9 product, not carrying over the dedicated external drive selector knob is also unfortunate. That or a similar easily reached mechanical selector is a differentiator between a more basic enthusiast camera and a camera designed for someone who is serious about photography.,3. The menu system is “improved” but for whatever reason Sony refuses to dump everything they’ve ever done with regard to menus and start with a whole new fresh design.,4. The touchscreen reeks of the result of an argument between engineering, marketing and finance and the result is embarrassing for a two-thousand dollar camera,5. The remaining ergonomics and general control placement, look and feel are behind the times, as if they can’t give up on the belief that interchangeable lens camera still have to look like a Nikon F or a Canon AE1.  I’m sorry to say this camera does not feel anywhere near as good as it should in-hand and they have missed the boat with regard to often-used controls naturally falling to hand without the user looking or thinking about it.,I promised to keep my opinions brief and there they are.  If you were a friend or relative and called me to ask if you should buy this camera (assuming you are qualified to know how to master its power and capabilities) my answer would be an unqualified yes. In my opinion, all things considered, there is no better choice of interchangeable lens camera for someone who is serious about photography as a hobby or to start a career in the business than this one.,The Mk III sibling in the A7 family is not revolutionary but rather evolutionary. As the next in lineage to the Mk II it continues the heritage started by the original A7 and compared to it maybe revolutionary sounds like a more appropriate word. The world will have to wait a little longer before Sony finally breaks the mold and releases the shackles that in some ways still bind it to their acquisition of Konica-Minolta back in 2006. It’s an “almost there” camera in so many ways, and trust me, if you are coming from a marriage with Canon or Nikon “enthusiast-grade” DSLR’s with the 7 III you will feel like you’ve suddenly turned into Marty McFly and are thrust back into the photography future at warp speed.,Already owning an a7 series and having some quality time with the newest a7 III am I excited enough to buy one?  One of the unfortunate things about some of what I have read from others seems to concentrate a lot on gadgets and features that don’t “necessarily” make this a camera that is more capable of huge gains in image quality but more in terms of usability. I appreciate the impressive auto-focus capabilities but because of my work and training I tend to focus manually far more than letting the camera do it for me. The same with auto-exposure enhancements, there is no doubt for some shooters the improvements are a big reason to step up to this model, for me not so much. Improved battery life?  Let’s be real, if you’re shooting photos for a living you are carrying spare batteries, if you are doing it as a hobby how many shots are you going to fire off in one session anyway?  And backing up for a second to image quality, I hope no one is going to judge what this camera is capable of by shooting with the kit lens, and do keep in mind that the compatible lens arsenal fits every a7 series and how much the lens influences image quality on this camera or any camera.,The a7 series currently encompasses three distinct categories – this all-around all-purpose model (which Sony for some reason calls “basic”), an ultra-high resolution model and a model optimized for low-light photography. Only you can decide which best fits your needs.  For me, right now until I spend a little more time with the a7 III in my hands if now is the right time or to wait to see what the next a9 will look like.  If I do order an a7 III I'll circle back and fill in the gaps with real-life hands-on reports.,I know this hasn’t been a “hands on” test which was not possible on the date of release but I do hope that some of this has been of help to you in making your decision.","April 10, 2018",5.0 out of 5 stars,PhotoGraphics

B07B43WPVK,Sony-Full-Frame-Mirrorless-Interchangeable-Lens-ILCE7M3,"Sony a7 III Full-Frame Mirrorless Interchangeable-Lens Camera Optical with 3-Inch LCD, Black (ILCE7M3/B)","Okay, so it is hard for me to come to grips with this, but I don't think I am going to be returning to Canon or Nikon.,The big, and basically only, CON:,AUTO FOCUS -  Okay, I'm really really on the fence about this, but I THINK I like the AF on this camera, mostly.  To give you some perspective, I was mainly using two 5D Mark III cameras for my portrait work, as well as trying out a couple of Nikon D750s and the AF on all of those those was all I've ever wanted. With those cameras, I've never had any issues whatsoever with autofocus.  It always worked, even in low light, whenever I wanted it.,Now comparing the Sony A7III to those, using the Sigma adapter and Sigma and Canon glass, I've had MOSTLY great success.  The EYE-AF is AMAZING for anytime that portrait sessions are going slowly/ people are not moving around too much.  I get A LOT more keepers when that is the case.  In my work, however, I really like to have movement.  I find that I get more natural body poses when movement is going on, and both the regular AF and the EYE-AF don't work great when I'm snapping photos under those conditions.  The camera can KIND OF focus when it is rapidly shooting, but it really seems to be a trade off - you either can focus, or you can shoot.... but not both at the same time like the Canon and Nikon excel at.,I am VERY disappointed about that - that is the one thing that is keeping me on the fence.,PRO's:,EVERYTHING else on this camera is AMAZING.,Here are some highlights that particularly excite me:,1) The customizability of the buttons - so much better than both Canon and Nikon.  And it has even improved over the A7RII !!! :),2) The dynamic range and how far you can pull the files is amazing.  I attached a photo out of an airplane window that I accidentally took at 4 stops (!!!) below what you see.  It was basically pitch black and my eyes could barely make out the ice below, but Sony, you're amazing, and this file came out great.,3) The Image Stabilization is legitimately amazing.  I can do handheld shots with my 270mm (135 + 2x extender) handheld at about 1/50th of a second and get sharp results 90% of the time.,4) 10FPS is way more than I ever need as a portrait photographer.... but I kind of like it sometimes.  :),Conclusion...,So because the AF is not quiiite at the point where it is flawless in high frame rate shooting, I am still interested and willing to see what Canon and Nikon come out with.  This camera is 90% of the perfect camera for me, and I could easily shoot it for the rest of my life... but it would be 100% perfect if the AF always worked in those fast movement/high frame rate kind of situations.","May 24, 2018",5.0 out of 5 stars,Black Walnut

If you have the right angle, one of the autofocus settings will get you the right shot at the right time.,The camera got wet multiple times, and finally I left it on the top of my car and it fell off while I was on the highway and landed on the road, someone returned it and it still worked!

Comes with three chords that when all put together Can be used to charge in the wall outlet. Then one chord can be used to charge in the computer. And one cord for the car.Super easy to use. To set up the camera is very simple and easy to figure out which button is which.It comes with a battery but no memory card the memory card I had to buy separately but it was not expensive and for the price of the camera I was not expecting it.It takes just your regular general memory card nothing fancy.The only issue I had with it was the arm strap. Even in the instructions it did not say how to attach it and we have yet to figure that out. So if someone could help us that would be great.The feature that helps you to get a focused picture even when you’re shaking a little bit works great.The instructions are pretty much basic and simple and so you may need to find out more information about it online.It works best for outdoor pictures I think. And the zoom is A very nice feature.They have continued to improve it in the past few years.It is lightweight but it has enough body to it to hold it easily when taking a picture.If there is no charge to the battery it takes approximately an hour to an hour and a half to charge.I purchased this camera for the purpose of taking outdoor nature pictures for the cards that I sell. And I am very pleased with the camera and so far think it is going to work great for that purpose.

B00I8BIC9E,Sony-DSCW800-Digital-Camera-Silver,Sony (DSCW800) 20.1 MP Digital Camera (Silver),"I have used Sony over the years because of their outstanding quality.  I read reviews before purchasing this one.  I take many, many pictures of mostly small Jewelry items.  I need a CRISP picture w/o graininess and good rich color.  I got neither.  I wish I had ordered my replacement sooner as this has been a big disappointment and I felt as if I maybe got a refurbished camera instead of a brand new one?  For the sake of two days, I am unable to return it.  Please do not buy if you need a camera for fine detailed pictures.  It will not do that for you.","September 8, 2018",2.0 out of 5 stars,B.

B00I8BIC9E,Sony-DSCW800-Digital-Camera-Silver,Sony (DSCW800) 20.1 MP Digital Camera (Silver),This is probably a good general camera but wasn’t what I looking for. I tried this out at a zoo but since most animals were moving the pictures came out blurry and I couldn’t find a setting to fix this. There is a delay from when you push the button to the picture being taken to the picture showing on the display. The display is pretty low resolution and made me wonder what the quality of the pictures truly were.,"November 12, 2017",2.0 out of 5 stars,Sara Amirahmadi
B00I8BIC9E,Sony-DSCW800-Digital-Camera-Silver,Sony (DSCW800) 20.1 MP Digital Camera (Silver),"I previously had a Canon S100, which was a good camera for me, but I damaged the racked out lens when it got bumped.  The S100 had worked well for me, but now is not available as new. I read the reviews of other cameras, and thought this Sony camera might be a good camera to use for shooting stills and video at concerts where the venue does not allow larger ""professional"" cameras.  I was very disappointed  in the auto focus function of this camera. It even has an auto-tracking selection where you are supposed to be able to pick a point in the frame to follow focus, but this was still not helpful in stills shooting, and did not seem to be an option for tracking focus in video shooting. I think my cell phone was a better choice for this purpose, but I had wanted a better optical zoom. This camera, despite the 5X zoom, still was not powerful enough to really get me the close ups I was looking for. I also has trouble with slow shutter speeds in a concert I took pix of, making horribly unusable photos. The menu also was not very intuitive.  Because of the focusing and slow shutter speed and menu issues, I promptly returned this for a refund, and received the refund quickly from Amazon.","August 23, 2018",2.0 out of 5 stars,Digster

B00I8BIC9E,Sony-DSCW800-Digital-Camera-Silver,Sony (DSCW800) 20.1 MP Digital Camera (Silver),"Hey the camera does have a slow exposure because of the small sensor. That did not bother me since it takes great photos. I know some people complain of the slow shutter. This is not a camera I would be taking to a sporting event or concert or birthday party. This camera is perfect for sightseeing and landscapes.,As I have other more expensive cameras for that type of photography.  I just wanted something compact to take on airplane when traveling and when I was traveling light. To take nice pictures. You know sometimes you are traveling and do not have time to carry around a dedicated camcorder and a hybrid point and shoot and a dslr. Sometimes you just want to enjoy the vacation and leave your fancy camera at home. That's where the dsc800 comes in handy. I will be updating this review with pictures.

It came a few days faster than expected. Well-packaged and everything in great condition.  I purchased the red-colored one and it's a gorgeous little piece of machine. It is small but doesn't feel cheap. Feels good in the hands and not too heavy. I briefly read the manual and was able to start taking photos and videos right away. The buttons feel very intuitive so far. Very pleased with the quality of the photos, especially close-up shots which I love to take. I took some test videos and for such a small camera, the quality of the audio and video seems really good. I love that the display screen can be adjusted. Makes it easy to experiment with some cool and unusual shots.,I haven't tried out the WiFi feature, but was able to connect to my computer really easily with the USB cable and download the photos with no problem. I'm really excited to use this camera. I bought a couple of other cameras I had to return, so I feel really good about keeping this one.,So far, from my first impression I would highly recommend this camera if you are looking for something not quite as expensive as a true professional camera, but still want something that takes great photos. I also love that it came with batteries you could use right away as well as a battery charger and rechargeable batteries.","November 30, 2018",5.0 out of 5 stars,Anastasia Lhasa Odessa

Some pictures on the auto setting don't come out as clear or blur.. So outside it works awesome I have great pics of the moon and some clear shots from a great distance away frpm the subjust og the oic, but once I go inside it makes it so i2have to use flash to gwt a clear pic which I dont always like beciase it changes the coloring.

It comes in 2 parts: the bottom, which stays attached to the camera via a tripod socket that screws into the camera's tripod socket; and the top, which is a ""hoodie"" that fits over the camera body and lens and attaches to the bottom part with three snaps. You're supposed to be able to let the top part dangle by one side snap while you take pictures, but mine was so heavy and the snap so loose that it consistently fell off. As another reviewer noted, the bottom part covers up the camera's side ports and door to the battery and memory card, requiring you to remove the whole case in order to access them. The faux leather is also thick and stiff. Although the case fit the camera well, I found it too unwieldy to be practical, despite its good looks.","November 27, 2013",1.0 out of 5 stars,Damon D.

I have used it on many occasions and for general picture taking it gives high quality and high pixel photos. It is in now standard form where the rear screen is used to select the picture. The camera has a flash and the focusing has a reasonable range.,However there are some things worth noting:,1. I cannot get good macro close ups of flowers. The combination of a poor macro and the rear image have yielded several out of focus pictures.,2. There is a significant time lag between taking pictures, 5 to 7 seconds before you can snap another. I do not know why this is the case so if you are trying to snap some fast motion pics this may not be for you.,Overall it fits neatly in a pocket and unless you rely solely upon you smart phone this is a well priced option for quality pictures in general.","August 31, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,Dr. Terrence McGarty

Also whenever you take a pictures it takes about 2 seconds to process which gets irritating because sometimes an object is moving and you might miss it because the camera is slow. Again if you are used to the iPhone camera but looking for something like that quality but in a digital camera this is not the one for you.

Stabilization, Touch Enabled 3-Inch LCD, Wi-Fi, DC-FZ80K (Black)","I have a very lengthy history with point and shoot cameras. I am a professional photographer so I suppose that I am spoiled by DSLR quality however Panasonic has never let me down. I bought a Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS3 when it first came out. I was thoroughly impressed with the quality for the price that I had paid. Concert videos came out great and a lot of the photos were really good too. I still have that Lumix and my son now uses it.,After dabbling with DSLRs for a while I decided that I wanted a more professional level point and shoot. I bought a Canon G12 and while it had some impressive features it just was not what I expected from the reviews I had seen. It was okay during concerts (one of the main reasons I have a point and shoot) but it wasn't something I was excited to use. After I sold the Canon I went to a Nikon Coolpix. I am an avid Nikon fan. That is the only DSLR I shoot with so I figured the point and shoot would be just as good. I was wrong. The quality of the photos was horrible and I couldn't get a clear shot to save my life. The Coolpix quickly went back. I stuck with the Panasonic Lumix ZS3 for a while and then went to a Nikon N1 J3. Again, not great. I did not like how it handled but I have kept it around for a year.,I was browsing reviews for cameras that are great for my upcoming trip to Disney. I saw this Lumix FZ70 listed so I did some more research. After reading reviews here on Amazon as well as other sources such as Ken Rockwell I decided that I would jump on the low price that I paid. Yet again Panasonic did NOT disappoint. I got the camera this morning so I have not been able to fully test it and will definitely update when I do, but from what I have done so far today...IMPRESSIVE. The zoom is ridiculous and much clearer than I expected it to be at 1200mm!,Below I posted a macro shot (holy crap!) and also posted a shot where the lens was at the shortest and then the longest length to show the power of the zoom. In the shot where you can see the entire street I put a red circle around the car that I zoomed in on. The red circle is in the center of the photo, far far down the street. I cannot wait to get out there and test this camera's capabilities in Disney in a few months and then at a concert in May.","February 17, 2015",5.0 out of 5 stars,Krystle

I got this before my Alaska trip, and boy was I happy to have it.  I got some bear pictures that look like I am in dangerous territory even though I could barely see the bear with my naked eye.  Awesome zoom.  The quality of the pictures are also quite good.  You can digitally zoom up by quite a bit and still have resolution adequate for printing.  It has lots of bells and whistles that I've yet to start digging in.  On the down side, It feels like it would probably break if I dropped it from a foot.  I've been careful so far.  So I don't know if it would handle a drop.  Since I don't really know, I cannot knock it.  Due to the picture quality per price alone, I highly recommend this camera.","July 18, 2015",5.0 out of 5 stars,John deLassus

B00I8BIC9E,Sony-DSCW800-Digital-Camera-Silver,Sony (DSCW800) 20.1 MP Digital Camera (Silver),"We got this camera for a 7 year old. It's compact and easy to use, but takes at least a second to respond after you press the shutter button. It also tends to select slow exposures (like 1/30 sec), even when using the flash. And it often simply does not focus. The result is that around 2/3 of the photos from it are either badly out of focus or show motion blur. It's frustrating because our daughter has a knack for photography and loves having her own camera, but this one is thwarting her efforts. I don't know if there are any good cameras in this price range; this one is pretty much a waste of money.","November 4, 2018",2.0 out of 5 stars,David MacKenzie

B00I8BIC9E,Sony-DSCW800-Digital-Camera-Silver,Sony (DSCW800) 20.1 MP Digital Camera (Silver),"Before I begin, my previous camera was a Sanyo vpcT1496R 14MP camera.,The people that say their phones are better either have brand new phones, which some of them come with 13MP+ cameras....or got a defective camera.,This is a good camera. I can actually use the zoom and it isn't always a blurry blob. (It can still be a blurry blob depending on settings, but it doesn't have to be) I haven't really messed with any settings. I've put it to where the display shows standard and not the actual quality of the photo to save battery, and the pictures still look way better than my old camera. I can't wait to someday go to the zoo and take pictures with this thing.,The battery life is fine.,I bought this from Focus Camera on Amazon. I mention this due to the one problem. I got the European version and I live in America. It came with a European charger which isn't compatible with American plugs. It came with an adapter that isn't even listed in the parts that can come with the camera....which means this could've been a used camera (albiet one that was taken care of) since someone had to open it to add the adapter that doesn't come with it. The adapter could be a POS and cause problems. Amazon did fix it by letting me order a charger and refunding me the amount (Amazon, not the seller). Note: the authentic looking chargers (the ones that look like the one it was supposed to come with) are the ones where you take the battery out to charge it. Which I dislike because that means every charge....gotta put the date in and everything (warning for those who get the correct charger),Minus the charger thing, it's a good camera. It's fairly cheap as well. Sony usually has good quality in their electronics, though you can always get a dud.,Edit: Since reviewing this, things have changed: This thing is flimsy. Out of NOWHERE the part that pushes out and pulls in the lens broke so now the camera refuses to do anything beyond tell me to turn it off and on again. So I can't suggest you buy this camera unless it's the only half decent one in your price range.","February 28, 2016",2.0 out of 5 stars,Yokuutsu

If you plan your shots, and lighting is ideal, this will produce magazine cover quality stuff.,* Easy to figure out, which is a good thing. Quick start instructions included leave out a lot of details. You can download full instructions, however.,* Small and light.,CONS,* Cheaply made, kind of an expectation in this price category.,* On and Off switch is small, and you have to stab it hard to get it to work. I don't think it will hold up to many such ""stabbings."",* Slow. You think you have a great shot, press shutter button, and it kicks in just as subject closes eyes or has moved to the next room. This is not the camera of choice if you want something you can just pull out of your pocket and grab a quick spontaneous shot.,Bottom Line: Nothing special. Nice pictures in quality detail, for sure. But it is not reliable. Slow. You will miss enough great shots as to make you want to cry. I am returning mine.

The one thing this camera lacks is a threaded mount for filters.  Even if you are using the filters to protect the lens, it's important to have the security of a threaded mount, not some force-fit add-on.,Otherwise, my only complaint is the same one I have for any camera that lacks a real viewfinder.  On a bright, sunny day, with the sun overhead, or behind you, no matter how much you turn up the view screen, you'll have trouble seeing much.  Everything else works just fine.,As for the accessories, the tabletop tripod is fine, the rest of the stuff is nothing to write home about, and the rechargable batteries wouldn't hold a charge for 2 weeks,(unused).","June 26, 2019",4.0 out of 5 stars,Robin Lynn Frank

I bought it for my girlfriend’s birthday and so far she seems reluctant to have it. She hardly read through the manual and is figuring everything out; mind you she is a beginner in photography. So that’s an important note that it is not super complex. With that being said, it is more than a simple camera. With photos, videos, and blue tooth options I say this camera takes beginner to a different level. Not only did we receive the camera, but a bag for it, memory cards, rechargeable batters with the charging port, cleaning kit, a stand and other stuff we are still figuring out.

I wanted a bridge camera that had a longer zoom than my fz200, didn't break the bank and was small and light enough to actually keep with me.  At 60x, fz70 has almost twice the optical zoom of my fz200 and I can still use the doubling lens I bought for the fz200 once I purchase an adapter if I need more than a 1200mm zoom.  Don't get me wrong, I love the fz200, the low light capabilities of the fz70 doesn't compare but the 60x zoom is nothing short of amazing.  The picture quality is fine for my needs (snapshots, travel photos, birding shots) and the camera is light enough to keep in my backpack.  I am a novice birder and the ability to get a decent picture of a bird a good distance away is helping me learn to id what I was missing before.  I am more than happy with this camera.,Pros:,- Did I mention it has a 60x optical zoom?,- Small enough to keep with me.  Can't get great pics if the camera is sitting at home.,- Picture quality is decent.  Not as good as the fz200 but you don't pay as much for this camera either.,Cons:,- Battery life.  Not great.  Can be extended by dimming the screen and turning off the setting to keep the focus motor going.,- File name conflicts.  Since I own two Panasonic cameras I have to be creative when importing photos.  There is no way to alter the file naming convention of PXXXXXXX.JPG so it is easy to overwrite files if both cameras are being used.  There is a site online that tells how to jump ahead in the numbering schema but that is just putting off the problem. [...]  I've resorted to uploading the files from this camera to a specific folder then running a script to change the filename from PXXXXXX.JPG to QXXXXXX.JPG.

B00I8BIC9E,Sony-DSCW800-Digital-Camera-Silver,Sony (DSCW800) 20.1 MP Digital Camera (Silver),I took a gamble and ordered this camera despite poor reviews about blurry photos. I was hoping others were having operator error issues. I am an intermediate photographer and shoot with a DSLR most of the time. I was looking for a pocket camera for quick snaps when a bulky camera is not convenient. I tried every possible setting on this camera and 99% of the time captured blurry images. I returned the camera within 2 days of purchase.,"November 21, 2018",2.0 out of 5 stars,N.R.

Everything is great, could not think of anything I would need to buy outside of this bundle except more memory cards. The camera took great pictures and videos, auto focus is good. The only downside for us was that the microphone would not pick up sound (conversation and narration) well, unless the photographer was doing the speaking. We anticipated this, so we bought an external microphone, unfortunately this camera (and all those in its class, Canon, etc) do not allow for external microphones, so we are returning it, as we have to buy a much more expensive camera to accomplish this.","June 21, 2019",5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazon Customer

Stabilization, Touch Enabled 3-Inch LCD, Wi-Fi, DC-FZ80K (Black)","Although I have had this camera for only a few weeks, I must say the FZ70 is one of the best values in digital camera. From here, all references to lens focal length will be in 35 mm film photography equivalent.,For about $300, you get a 60X lens that stretches from a heretofore unheard of 20 mm ultra wide to 1200 mm super telephoto, all in a relatively small and light package. Most super zoom cameras have a zoom range of 24X to 50X, and the wide end usually starts at 24 mm or 28 mm. You won't believe how much wider 20 mm is until you compare pictures of the FZ70 with ""lessor"" super zooms taken at the widest setting.,If you shoot video, the microphone's sound gathering capability will adjust with the zoom lens's focal length, so that even when you zoom in, you can get good sound from a distance.,Other than being an excellent value, the FZ70 gives you the ultimate in convenience. There is no need to haul a whole bag of heavy lenses in order to take different shots. The magic is in the size of the image sensor, which is 1/2.3 inch. This is much smaller than sensors in APS-C or Micro Four-Thirds cameras. But also because of its smaller size, it becomes possible to design a super zoom camera with an astonishing zoom range. If you use a full-frame camera, the zoom range is about 3X to 4X at most before the lens physical size, weight, and cost become prohibitive.,So the trade-off is image quality vs. convenience vs. cost. The FZ70 takes, IMHO, excellent pictures and video. It won't do as well in low light situations when compared to cameras with larger sensors, but the pictures and videos are still very good to excellent.,I prefer using the zoom lens on this kind (superzoom/bridge) of camera, because it allows quick AND smooth zooming action using the convenient, powered zoom ring around the shutter release. Most DSLR cameras do not have this feature; you need to twist the zoom lens itself, which cannot be done smoothly throughout its zooming range. This is especially important when shooting video.,If you want to know more about this camera, both before and after purchase, you can download two official FZ70 owner's manuals by googling ""fz70 owner's manual"". The Basic manual is 34 pages long, while the Advanced manual is 226 pages.,For me, I believe that the best camera is one that I can take with me all the time, without straining my neck, shoulder, or wallet.,I highly recommend the Panasonic Lumix FZ70 for convenience and travel photography. While others miss shots contemplating which lens to use and changing lenses, you won't. ;-)","December 14, 2013",5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazonian Consumer

(uses film so ..).  My next purchase was a Canon Elph which takes excellent pictures.  And,now this one!,The vision in my right eye has deteriorated and the Elph screen was a little small for me to see the scene like I wanted.  I love to take pictures and decided to purchase this one.  The quality of pictures is excellent, it is easy to use and the battery life is good, so far.  I have taken over 60 pictures and haven't had to charge the battery yet.,I am still in the learning mode but the camera reminds me of the first Canon I owned in the early 1970's.

Most patient with me when I told them I was visually impaired.,This one comes with a small tripod, a nice case plus a few other accessories.

I order this camera for my parents as daily carry camera so they can capture some interesting photo of their daily life while I am not with them.  They love it because they are not tech person, they not even know all the features on their smartphone. I spend 5 mins to reading manual and setup the camera 10mins to explain to them how to use. After one hour they are good to go with this camera.,Pros:,1. Easy to use, nothing complicate on/off, shutter, zoom and menu button.,2. Super lightweight, maybe been use DSLR for while this camera just too lightweight for me, even lighter than my mobile phone.,3. Better than mobile phone quality picture (If you are mobile phone photographer NVM),4. Good battery life. This will save some battery juice for my parents smartphone.,Nothing is prefect there still something need to watch out.,Cons:,1. Poor quality on the LCD screen. If you loading your photo to your computer it will look so much better than you check it on the LCD screen on the camera.,2. So lightweight mean sometime you can't get a stable shot,3. Menu language limitation there only few major languages are available not many choice as other model.,4. Video quality is kind of noise but still acceptable.,Over all me and my parents both are happy with this camera.  They can always carry a camera to anywhere they going now. I mean for this price range and the quality we got I am happy with it. Of course if you are look for better image quality and rich features camera, look for other this just good enough for daily snapshot, you have to pay the right price to get the right quality tool.","April 26, 2015",5.0 out of 5 stars,W.

Stabilization, Touch Enabled 3-Inch LCD, Wi-Fi, DC-FZ80K (Black)","The camera is fantastic. I'm not going to repeat what others already wrote, but I wanted to add a few things:,1. Panasonic is using a strange folders naming on the SD card where the video clips are hiding. It reminds me Sony. Never understood why it is needed to have the video clips (which are MTS files and not AVI, MOV or whatever you saw before) buried three levels down in the card.,2. When the camera is turned ON, there is a strange noise that never stops but increases when the lens is extended. If you place your ear above the Mic, you can hear it well... When you switch the mode to Play, the noise goes away. It is there always and only when the camera is in capturing mode... all modes.,3. The Flash shoe, as nice as it may be, does not work with all mountable flashes. I tried the Nikon SB600 and no joy. When I press the shutter button to take a picture, the flash resets and recharges, but there is no flash light... So the shutter causes the short to tell the flash to reset, but not receiving the command to fire it, strange.,4. The lack of a lens hood is an issue, especially when you have a lot of light using the zoom. I found a rubber hood with a 55mm thread outside (that fits to the camera thread) and 55mm inside, so you can attach a filter to protect the lens. Of course, found it here on Amazon.,I've added a few images of a mountain and cactus using the different zoom settings. You can find those images at the Users Gallery above.,Although I have a few minor issues with the camera, I still gave it 5 stars because the number of features that are built into this body and the X60 zoom are just remarkable. I use a DSLR full time and adding this lens in a shape of a camera, as much as there is a difference between the two, is a great way to be more mobile. I am testing more features every day and will update this post with what I find.","October 10, 2013",5.0 out of 5 stars,Devek Maga

I wanted a super-zoom too and got the Coolpix P530 because we use Nikon's at my office and I was very familiar with the interface. Well, this Lumix definitely outperformed my Coolpix. It has a longer zoom, which I knew ahead of time. I could not get the Coolpix to adjust focus when I shot video and zoomed in and out, there was audible noise on the zooms. And the Lumix has the ability to adjust photos in the camera, which is pretty cool and which we are all getting used to on our smartphones. When I got back, I returned the Coolpix and purchased this Lumix, and have not regretted it a bit. I'm sure I haven't taken it through all of it's bells and whistles, but so far, I'm very pleased with the purchase.","April 28, 2014",5.0 out of 5 stars,Laura Jesberg

As with all digital cameras, it has many functions which I will probably never use, but access to this camera's,adjustments and settings is much easier and more intuitive than the old camera.  In other words, Panasonic has produced a new model that improves greatly on the old model.  I'm glad I bought it.","August 11, 2014",5.0 out of 5 stars,Jerry

Stabilization, Touch Enabled 3-Inch LCD, Wi-Fi, DC-FZ80K (Black)","I've used this camera for quite a while now, so that I could give my honest review.  I'm a professional photographer and I wanted a lighter, smaller camera for certain situations when it's impractical/hard to haul around my DSLR and lenses.  As familiar as I am with digital cameras it took a while to learn all the features and how to get to what I wanted quickly, such as auto bracketing, but I'm becoming faster with experience.  For the most part it's a wonderful camera, and I couldn't be happier with the amazing zoom.  I believe the onboard stabilization works well, and I've gotten some good shots provided the light is good and it's not extended quite fully. I've been happy with the overall sharpness. It's easy to handle and seems to be pretty sturdy. I'm still working with the white balance, as it tends to shoot towards the cyan side, but that can be easily adjusted later in post production.  I also like the macro feature. There are so many features and I'm having fun exploring all of them.,I do have a couple of gripes with the camera, the first of which is the amount of noise. I've read that others don't seem to see it, but I'm dealing with as high a resolution image I can get, and unless the light is optimal where I can shoot with a 100 or 200 iso setting I need to do a lot of post processing. (I could use a tripod, but if I was going to haul that along I'd bring the big camera.)  Low light situations do give you good color and sharpness, though. The other issue, and the most worrysome, is the delay in writing to the card.  There is a limited burst feature that can be somewhat helpful although it only gives you 3 shots.  I'm using a Transcend 32GB SDHC Class 10 card which has proven to be fast in my DSLR, but still quite slow in this camera. This means that it's not as good for some wildlife (or small children and dogs) shots and the like, as if your subject is moving you'll need to wait up to a full second between shots.,These annoyances are balanced with the price and features.  Everything dealing with photography is about compromise. :)  This the most I wanted to spend on this type of camera, and I'm very happy with the return on my money. If I wanted a little more more I would have had pay a lot more.,I've attached a few examples I took yesterday late in the afternoon, when the light was starting to fade. The first one of the tree trunk and grass was taken with iA which exposed with a 3200 iso, which as you can see is very grainy (to be expected with that exposure and conditions).  The second one, of the reeds, was taken with the zoom and aperture priority, with an iso fo 400.  The third one, skyline and blue sky, was also with an almost fully extended lens and iso of 200. These were all shot RW2 and are at 100% resolution.","July 22, 2017",4.0 out of 5 stars,Helen

I'm a near-professional photographer with 40 years' experience using every type of camera imaginable. I also like a bargain. So I bought the Panasonic. Even though it was refurbished, it arrived without a scratch and in perfect condition.

She's having a grand time taking photos. We bought an SD card for 10 bucks to store the photos on; I'm not sure the camera would store them without it. Since it isn't marketed for children with a colorful kid-proof body or built-in games (which I really didn't want), it feels like the grown-up item that it is. It's easy enough to operate without reading the manual although some of the butttons are tiny and hard to see without reading glasses. The pictures are clear.

To be fair to the company, shipping was much faster than expected which was great since I purchased this for my impatient 6 year old. However, quality of the product is FAR below the reviews. The camera is very cheaply made and feels like it’ll break in your hands at any moment. There is a switch on the side of the camera that changes between close up and scenic views that feels like it’s going to break the whole camera every time I use it. The camera never focused for any image (I’m experienced with photography and couldn’t get it to focus) and after fully charging the battery for over 15 hours it died after only 3 pictures. I would strongly urge you to reconsider purchasing this product and go with a better known proven point and shoot.

In 30 minutes of trying, I got 2. After which it totally froze both times.,And those were the times it didn't:,Turn off as soon as you pressed the shutter,Screen turned solid blue (been a long time since I've seen a BSOD) upon trying to format the memory card,Went to a solid crosshatch and was unresponsive,Just turned right back off as soon as it powered on.,Turned on and froze and wouldn't turn off unless you held the power down for 10 seconds.,Turned on and froze and wouldn't turn off unless even if you held the power button for 30 seconds, requiring a battery pull.,The battery was horrible tight, and there's no way you can get fingers in, nor could you do even the gentlest of taps to help it out a little, because the skinny, flimsty, waiting-to-be-broken-off battery cover hinges on the narrow side, making it super weak. Luckily, I hadn't trimmed my nails in a few days...,Repeat ad nauseum for a full 30 minutes.,Then it let me take 2 pictures.,Well, maybe I won't right a stinker of review if the pics are OK.,They're awful, look at the grain, blurriness - and this only at ISO 640!,If this was 10 years ago, it'd be fine.,But I can spend $40 and get a action camera with WiFi, with a waterproof case, that I bought because I wanted something I was less afraid to take risks with. It's been to Hawaii, snorkeling, it's been on a 30ft selfie stick tacking pictures in a factory, mountain biking, hung out the side of a convertible - flawless. And the image quality on that is MUCH better.,The only reason I got this instead, is that the action cam is a fixed, super-wide fisheye - not great for photography, but fine for oddball landscapes or action shots - it's pretty niche.,The unreliability I can forgive, but I know what the bathtub curve is and sometimes it just sucks to be one of the people at the top, on the start of that graph.,But this is 2005 CMOS camera quality.

To begin with, the micro-font instruction manual states that the package includes a digital camera, ProTags Express Software Installation CD, USB cable, User's instruction manual, Strap, Camera bag, Lithium battery, and a charger.  There is no CD nor is there a charger in the kit.  In fact, I called Amazon to send a second camera for the missing parts, and they were not in the second shipment either.  Second, it is nearly impossible to configure the camera with optimum settings.  I am not unfamiliar with cameras and electronics, but I had trouble paging through the settings.  I even had a highly skilled techie friend try to set up the camera and the best we could get out of any of the pictures were grainy shots less than 2 megabytes.

Stabilization, Touch Enabled 3-Inch LCD, Wi-Fi, DC-FZ80K (Black)","I think many people including me bought this camera because of its 60X zoom.  The zoom is remarkable, but after you use the camera for a while you find out some wonderful things that are not really talked about.,First, the camera does a remarkable job recognizing back lite scenes and compensates remarkably well.  If for example you open the flash and there is a bright window behind the person whose picture you are taking it compensates perfectly.  Often it can compensate for back lite without the flash, but it will remind you when back light requires flash.,Second, with flash skin tones are remarkable.  Also, most flashes on little cameras wash out at close range this one doesn't.  It also compensates so that you don't find people up close are overexposed while everything in the background goes dark.  Obviously this only works up to a point.,I always shoot with the the red label (iA). you have nothing to lose and much to gain. This provides a modest HDA exposure that doesn't scream ""manipulation"" and also, I believe, provides some sharpening.,Even with a sturdy tripod it is just about impossible to keep the camera steady while pushing the shutter button at 60X.  So use time delay with your tripod on long shots.,Robert I. Rhodes","April 20, 2014",5.0 out of 5 stars,retired professor

Stabilization, Touch Enabled 3-Inch LCD, Wi-Fi, DC-FZ80K (Black)","I gave it 5 stars in reference to the price. While you'll never mistake the photos taken by this for photos from a nice dslr, for the money this camera performs really well. The balance is a little strange since the majority of the weight is the excellent zoom, but is comfortable enough in the hand for the average application. High speed shooting is definitely not a strength; it's not recommended for birding unless you're comfortable being very persistent and are prepared to shoot A LOT, which is unacceptable to most birders. Indoor shooting is okay in most lighting conditions, though it struggles in low light. The flash is powerful for a pop-up, as with all cameras the learning curve for indoor shots is a bit steeper. I may sound a bit negative, but overall I really like the performance vs. price. For the average user, I highly recommend this product.","May 7, 2014",5.0 out of 5 stars,J. Koyen

The controls are not as easy as the Pentax that I returned before buying this, but the picture quality is better the zoom lens is astonishing! The only drawback is the manual. The one provided with the camera is scant on information, enough to get the owner up and running,but not much else. I needed more detail. A manual comes on the cd to be downloaded and then printed if desired, however, I could not get it to print. I wound up ordering the manual from a third party, so now I have the manual that should have come with the camera in the first place. Who in the world is going to carry a computer around all over the place so that he or she can refer to it while getting accustomed to the camera. Not me, that is for sure.

It just focuses on whatever it wants to - which is 99% of the time not what you want it to focus on. The photo quality is terrible. I'm no professional, but I know what I'm doing with a camera and even I cannot get a photo in good focus. And you can accidently brush the shutter button and end up taking 2-4 photos in a row without meaning to... you don't have to press, take a photo, press, take a photo. You can press press press (not meaning to do it multiple times) and get photo taken, photo taken, photo taken... all slightly delayed but one after another... if that makes sense.

Stabilization, Touch Enabled 3-Inch LCD, Wi-Fi, DC-FZ80K (Black)","This is my third lumix. These products perform. I had a much older version of this one which I loved but let the family borrow it to go whale watching. There were several versions of the story but all indications are that the camera hit the deck hard. Never quite worked after that. I use the camera for work so I replaced it quickly with one of the smaller Lumix cameras. It was wonderful and I used it daily for the past 3 years. But I have large hands and yearned for the larger model. This new camera has several advantages over the smaller Lumix's and it's predasesser as well.,The image stabilizer is terrific. I'm a Real Estate Appraiser and I buzz past recently sold houses and listed houses while I snap a picture. My photos come out beautifully. I use many pictures in my appraisal files and require very small picture files - thumbnails really. Well this camera easily adjusts the picture size down, then back to larger files later for family shots. That's the other thing - I also bought this camera to update my video camera. The motion picture button is a great convenience and while I've only used it a couple times so far, it appears to produce great video. I pop up the flash for house interiors and get great results. Sometimes it does this thing where it takes multiple images then combines them into one. Then it makes you wait a sec while it saves that. I'd just assume it just flash since the resulting pics are just ok - so that's one thing. But then I put down the flash and work outside and the camera transitions beautifully.  One last thing - the optical zoom works well.,Some appraisers are using their iPhones and putting the pics right into the file. That's pretty kool and I get that. But using a real camera still gets a way better result than a phone. I'm sticking with my Lumix.","June 28, 2014",5.0 out of 5 stars,Terry

Stabilization, Touch Enabled 3-Inch LCD, Wi-Fi, DC-FZ80K (Black)","For a light weight digital camera it is good for some events and not so much for others.  I've only had this camera for a month as a backup to my higher end cameras.  From the lower zoom to about the 500 mm zoom the photos are good when shot in RAW (JPG starts to get fuzzy and grainy early in the 30x zoom range and because I take a lot of nature and landscape photos the 500 to 1200 (60x range) the photos quality diminishes. I'm comparing the quality with higher-end DSLR cameras/lens and that might not be fair since this is not promoted as comparable. Close up and objects not more than 100-150 feet the camera is good.  I would not recommend this camera if you are looking for overall great optics and low pixelation (the effect caused by zooming in on a photo making pixels visible). Shooting in the RAW mode does help however it uses up a lot of memory and battery (fewer photos on a memory card and battery drainage).  I've been shooting since the early 1970 (film) and digital higher end DSLR's from the very early 2000's.  I'll keep experimenting to see if I can improve the photo quality to the point I would like it to be... but until then ""It's O.K."" (3 stars) is the best I can give it.","January 10, 2014",3.0 out of 5 stars,William Moore

I am a rank Amateur and don't pretend to KNOW everything about cameras but I do know what I like and don't like., That said...  I so wanted a LONG LENS camera but knew the traditional DSLR's were more than I could handle.. too heavy and too many lens to carry ..  so I have been buying bridge cameras but wanted one with a SUPER long LENS.,..  I had bought a Panasonic in the past and was very pleased with it.. since then have bough Canon's,  Fuji's and Samsungs... but  there s something about the FEEL of this camera in my hand that makes me SMILE.. it fits perfectly... Button's are were they are suppose to be and easy to access.. The camera fits into a standard camera case... and not a lot of extra's are needed to make this an amazing tool.,  The onboard menu is easy to understand.. and MAKES SENSE.. it follows logical progression... something I don't often do but other might but it has some great in camera EDITING... options.,  The weight of this camera is nominal.. easy to handle and carry either around you neck or in a sm  camera bag.,As  I previous said it fits my hand well....that is one thing I leaved from buying a variety of cameras from various makers.. If it doesn't feel good in you hand as SOON as you pick it up.. it will never feel comfortable.. no matter what.., ..... One thing the camera does NOT have is wifi access.. I easily solved that with a EYE FI Mobi SD card.. ( works PERFECTLY)...not knowing how well I might like it I go the sm size a 8 gig and .. Honestly that is wonderful.... you can transfer you photos as soon as you take them to a tablet or cell phone..  and NO WI FI SIGNAL IS NEEDED...  but this isn't what your interested in...,.......  The camera has some surprising and easy to use features that I was UNAWARE of when I bought it... I has a very easy to sue Panorama option...... and it has a 3D option to use while taking videos.. ( you can only use this if you view your 3D pictures on a tv w 3 D capabilities ) but it is something I was not aware that it could do..,.......  Videos are NICE... bright and clear and sounds has definitely been improved over my previous Panasonic.,Lots of creative filters to try out  but  you can completely let the camera do all the heavy lifting for picture taking if you don't want to MESS with all those setting.. the auto modes on this camera do a bang up job.,  Honestly... I can't say that I want or NEED anything else on this camera... other than the missing wifi access which I easily solved.. for me this camera is a Perfect Match..,  I got a great MONO pod to use when taking the LONG Telephoto shots...  and a few lens filters.. and I am totally SET,I am delighted with this product and Highly recommend it .,....... Buy one and go out and take some amazing photos .. your friends and family will be Shocked and Delighted, .","July 17, 2014",5.0 out of 5 stars,Mocha's mom

When I unwrapped the camera, it appeared smaller than I expected but that was a good thing. It had a great feel in my hand and I was looking forward to trying it out. I went through all the steps in the instruction manual, attaching the straps, downloading the bluetooth app for my phone, installing the 64G card that came with it and the batteries. I turned the camera on, I was led through instructions on connecting my phone with the camera via bluetooth. I accomplished a connection and moved to the next screen which was ""Turn off the camera and then turn it back on"". Which I did...many many times, each time it would only return to the same message to restart the camera. I even removed the batteries and restarted it twice only to the same effect so I asked for a refund. I was sent an RMA label but it cost me 34.00 more dollars to send it back since it was not a prepaid label. so my rating is more for the experience and not for the way the camera works, obviously.

B019UDHT6U,Canon-PowerShot-Digital-Camera-Stabilization,Canon PowerShot ELPH 180 Digital Camera w/Image Stabilization and Smart AUTO Mode (Red),Camera is a piece of crap. I bought a Cannon camera about 10 years ago and I was comparing the two.  Turns out my old one is much better quality this one's just a cheap piece of plastic and the picture quality is terrible yet it was the same price as my old one. I am no longer going to buy Cannon.,"April 10, 2018",1.0 out of 5 stars,liz

B019UDHT6U,Canon-PowerShot-Digital-Camera-Stabilization,Canon PowerShot ELPH 180 Digital Camera w/Image Stabilization and Smart AUTO Mode (Red),"My last Canon I had was a Powershot SD1100IS that I had since 2008. I definitely  thought it was time for an upgrade. I really wanted the ELPH 190, but the 180  fit me, budget-wise. I was a bit irked that it didnt come in more colors so I went with silver. When it arrived I noticed the box was much smaller than my last Canon. I opened it and realized this one doesn't come with a CD or USB cable. The disc, I dont mind, but why no cable? Also, it was VERY frustrating and difficult to attach the wrist strap to the camera!! It is made weird and the instructions were no help. (Had to go online and download the instructions - the booklet that came with tells you to do so.) I had to use Super Floss to string it through since dental floss wasn't pliable enough and a toothpick was too hard. Camera also looks cheap and very lightweight. Battery is also hard to insert and remove! It does take good pics from what I can tell. The zoom feature is great and takes clear zoom photos even from far away. If it wasn't for the fact that I need a camera for an event this week, I would return it right away and go with something else. Anyway, I don't recommend this camera.  It's much better ones that also takes great pics, but much easier and less frustrating.","June 7, 2017",2.0 out of 5 stars,y.w.

I am visiting my retired Mechanical Engineer son in a different state in October and he thinks he can get in.  If he can't get it in, it is hopeless.  Also, the cord they recommend to get pictures on the computer does not work.

B019UDHT6U,Canon-PowerShot-Digital-Camera-Stabilization,Canon PowerShot ELPH 180 Digital Camera w/Image Stabilization and Smart AUTO Mode (Red),"DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY! Horrible quality, very cheap made, can't focus and have to turn off and on, so it starts to focus properly again. Unbelievable low quality for Canon, coudn't imagine that Power Shot could be such a bad camera. I had a few Power Shot cameras starting from 2005 and this particular one is be aware. Absolutely waste of money, the camera makes even specific clicking and clacking noise then is trying to focus on a subject. Again, from 11 years of using Power Shot the biggest disappointment.

Stabilization, Touch Enabled 3-Inch LCD, Wi-Fi, DC-FZ80K (Black)","I agree with many others that this is one of the best cameras you can get for the money. A great starter camera or even for veteran photographers that are looking for lots of zoom without the cost and weight of DSLRs. For only $250 (at the time of this writing) you get 1200mm range, insanely wide 20mm photos, and a camera that takes above average photos even in fairly low light. It also has allot of nice manual modes to go along with a very smart auto mode. It focuses pretty fast and pictures look good until you get really far into the zoom. Then you either need a good tripod or better lighting to take a really good pic from range. Impressively I was able to follow some aircraft while keeping long range zoom most of the time. Although once you do lose focus, it's hard to find it again.,The main reason I got this camera was not for the picture quality but for the Movie Mode. I like documenting fast moving high altitude aircraft like Contrails and Chemtrails (Yes I said it) and many other interesting things in the sky. Since there seem to be hardly any decent Camcorders with any kind of serious zoom range, I had to look into Photo Cameras. The movies that this camera does take are quite impressive in terms of audio and video for a camera mainly meant for Photography. But one of the reasons I chose this camera other than taking decent photos was for smooth 60 Frames Per Second Video. The claims that this camera can do 60FPS are completely false because after you really dig, you find out the Sensor is limited to 30FPS. So even though the video may be encoded at 60FPS, you only see 30 because the sensor is limited to that frame rate. This is not a big deal to probably 90% of people that buy this camera but some want a dual solution for good photos/video.,I'm now returning to try out the Olympus SP-100 that seems to have similar features as the FZ70 with a little higher price tag. Along with high speed video modes and a better motion tracking system for birds or other fast moving long distance craft. It seems true lifelike 60FPS is very hard to find on superzooms. I will miss the 20mm wide photos that this great camera is capable of.,Again I want to point out that I rated this camera 4 Stars and find it to be on the best values out there for a camera period. It just didn't completely fit my needs of what I expected in a very competitive Superzoom field. For others who don't care about the stuff I mentioned, this is a 5-Star camera in most every way when you consider the price tag.,UPDATE: I tested out the Olympus SP-100 and the Lumix totally destroys it. The noise on the Olympus is terrible and almost unusable in low light. The picture quality is smartphone quality at best. The stablization is poor and does not look like 60FPS either like it claims. ARRGH. Guess I'll have to be satisfied with the Lumix as there is not much in the way of high framerate video for superzooms.","August 2, 2015",4.0 out of 5 stars,Jeremy

(My DMC-5 is ultra fast, and it is by no means a high-end camera.),If you are using the (very cool) high-zoom feature to capture a distant shorebird or diminutive warbler, this camera will ""hunt"" for several seconds trying to get it into focus.  And, as you know, that's all it takes for the bird to be gone.  And forget trying to capture a bird in flight against the sky as a background!  It simply will not focus.,Also, it is also slow in writing to the SD card.  This makes it very hard to take a quick burst of shots of a moving bird.,One last thing.  I am a man with a large hand, and find this camera too bulky for ease of control manipulation.  Many people would find the camera to be too large.","July 26, 2017",3.0 out of 5 stars,H. B.

I've owned this camera's bigger buddy the Panasonic GH4 for a few years and am used to the controls and the camera's firmware.  Panasonic does a great job with their auto-focus implementation as well as the camera's software, particularly the touchscreen implementation.,For such a tiny sensor comparatively to the GH4 (and even other mirrorless cameras my Sony A7R2), it does a good job.  If you pixel peep at the images, they're definitely not going to be the same quality as a $3K camera and $1k lens combination for a pro-level mirrorless or DSLR.  But, those same pro cameras cannot touch the zoom range of this camera.  If there's enough light, the pictures and video from this camera as outstanding, given the camera's sensor's limitations.  The stabilization is also fantastic.  You can hand-hold a lot of shots and video that would never turn out with a camera+lens without stabilization.,Pros:,* Unbelievable zoom range,* Good quality photos and video with enough light,* Stabilization is fantastic,* Panasonic's camera firmware, menus and touchscreen implementation are top-notch,* Great battery life, cheap after-market batteries as well.  I recommend these batteries and charger: ,* Fantastic remote control and live view of the camera from a smartphone or tablet.  Panasonic's remote control and live view implementation is hands-down the best among all the camera vendors.,Cons:,* Low light or fast-action shots without a lot of light are challenging,* Zoom mechanism is a little rough and not smooth (likely because the lens is so light but the zoom range is so unbelievably long),Highly recommended camera for general purpose walk-around shots.","August 19, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,H.

But more times than not, when I zoomed into the bird it was just a blur and I lost my opportunity.  Even on the same bird shot, if I got one clear, it would then blur and I couldn't get another.

B019UDHT6U,Canon-PowerShot-Digital-Camera-Stabilization,Canon PowerShot ELPH 180 Digital Camera w/Image Stabilization and Smart AUTO Mode (Red)," DISCLAIMER: (Yup, gonna be on every review I do from now on),This review is based solely on my facts and findings during the use of the Camera. I am, IN NO WAY, associated with Canon, the Seller or their partners/affiliates and I am NOT required to do this review. I may relate my opinions during this review, but they are simply that... my own opinions and are not meant to coerce anyone into buying this product. I hate having to do this, but I do a lot of reviews and want everyone to know that my reviews are Honest, Unbiased, and Factual (you can thank Amazon for this Disclaimer being on every review that I do now).,Why only four (4) stars? The LCD isn't as crisp looking as the actual Pictures and Videos really are and the Function/MENU settings are a bit cumbersome to learn (i.e. When/where they can be used as well as learning what options are available when using them).,GETTING STARTED:,Before buying this camera I would suggest that you download the User Manual to familiarize yourself with the Features and Functions of this camera. Also, this camera doesn't come with a SD card, nor does it have internal memory to store your pictures and videos, so you will need to purchase one before you are able to use this camera.,The first thing you will need to do is charge the battery using the included charger. Make sure to line up the Triangles when inserting the battery into the charger base and then plug it in to a power source (depending on which charger you have, USB or wall, will dictate your power source).,While the battery is charging, take a moment and insert your SD Card. Make sure to insert it correctly so as not to damage your memory card or camera - the metal contacts should face the front of the camera as you insert it.,I will not be going through every Feature and Function of the camera as it would be too in-depth to do so. However, you should be familiar with the Function Button on the back of the camera (It's the round dial on the back of the camera about in the middle on the right side). Here is a quick overview:,* Green AUTO Button - Changes between AUTO and Programming (P) modes and is the UP Button,* Gray INFO Button - Turns on and off the Information displayed on the LCD screen and is the DOWN Button,* Lightning Bolt Icon Button - Changes the Flash modes and is the RIGHT Button,* Person Icon Button - Turns on the Auto Focus Feature and is the LEFT Button,* Func. Set (Center) Button - Accesses the Function Menu and is the SET (OK) Button,NOTE: The Power Button is the Small Round Button on the Top of the Camera, The Shutter Button is the Large Round Button on Top of the Camera, The Zoom Lever is the Lever around the Shutter Button, The Playback Button is Button with the Green Play Icon just to the upper right of the LCD screen on the back of the Camera, The Record Button is the Button with the Red Dot just to the right of the Playback Button, The Delete Button is the Button with the Trash Can Icon just to the lower right of the LCD screen on the back of the Camera, and finally... The MENU Button (Self explanatory) is just to the right of the Delete Button. Watch the Video for the location of these Buttons.,After the battery is completely charged (the Amber Light will turn Green), insert the battery into the camera by aligning the Triangle Icon on the battery with the Battery Holder Tab then pull the Tab back towards the front of the camera and insert the battery until it locks into place.,Now that your camera is ready to use, let's get started learning how to use it.,If this is the first time you are powering on your camera you will notice that there is an option to set the Date, Time and Daylight Savings Time. You do not have to do this for the camera to operate correctly. It is used to store EXIF data pertaining to your pictures and videos that you take as well as Date Stamp them. If you do not know what EXIF data is, please look it up so that you may understand the security issues that could be of concern to you.,SETTING THE DATE:,You will need to use the Function Dial to set, or change, the Date and Time. Use the Up/Down Buttons to specify the current Date then use the Right/Left Buttons to move to the next option. Again, use the Up/Down Buttons to set the current time. If you are satisfied with how everything looks, you can press the Func. Set Button to advance to the next option or you can change the way the Date is displayed and select Daylight Savings Time. When you are satisfied with your settings, press the Func. Set Button to proceed to the next option.,On the next menu you will be able to change, or select, you current Time Zone. Use the Right/Left Buttons to select your Time Zone and press Func. Set to complete the process.,You can skip the above settings, but every time you power on your camera you will have to press Func. Set to skip the process. Note: You can change/set the above options at any time by pressing the MENU Button. Here's how:,* Press the MENU button,* Move the Zoom Lever or the Right/Left Buttons to highlight the Tools Icon,* Use the Up/Down Buttons to move through the settings until you highlight the Date/Time... option,* Press the Func. Set Button and then use the Up/Down & Right/Left Buttons to adjust your new settings.,* Press the Func. Set Button to complete the process,SETTING YOUR LANGUAGE:,If you are still in the Tools Menu, simply move to the Language option in the menu - it is the next to last option listed - otherwise proceed as follows:,* Press the MENU Button and move to the Tools Icon,* Use the Up/Down Buttons to move to the Language option in the menu and press Func. Set,* Use the Up/Down & Right/Left Buttons to navigate to your desired Language and press Func. Set,* Press the MENU Button to exit the menu - NOTE: Use the MENU Button any time you wish to exit ANY menu you are in.,TAKING YOUR FIRST PICTURE:,* Power on the Camera (As you power on the Camera look at the upper right hand side of the LCD display and note if ""P"" or ""AUTO"" is displayed - If AUTO is displayed then skip the next step),* Press the Green AUTO Button to select AUTO Mode (The AUTO Mode simply tries to set the Camera to the best options respective to your immediate environment),* Use the Zoom Lever to adjust your desired Zoom level,* Press & Hold the Shutter Button 1/2 way down to allow the Camera to automatically Focus and adjust the appropriate settings for your picture,* Press the Shutter Button fully to take your picture,NOTE: Please observe the LCD screen when holding the Shutter Button 1/2 way down for warning information regarding settings that may need some attention. Also, while in AUTO Mode your setting options will be limited. In Programming (P) Mode, you will have full control of all your Camera setting options that it is capable of using. Again, I will not be going through these two (2) modes as they are very in-depth.,TO VIEW YOUR PICTURE(S):,* Press the Green Play Button to enter Playback Mode,* Use the Right/Left Buttons to Scroll through your pictures for viewing - NOTE: You can press the Func. Set Button for more options during picture viewing.,RECORDING YOUR FIRST VIDEO:,* Select AUTO or Programming (P) Mode, as previously mentioned, then press the Func. Set or MENU Buttons to set any options for recording your video,* Press the Red Record Button (See above if you've forgotten where it is),* Use the Zoom Lever for Wide/Telephoto zoom level,* Press the Red Record Button again to stop recording - NOTE: During recording, the Lens movement (noise) while zooming In/Out will be recorded. Preset your zoom level to prevent this if it is an issue with you.,PLAYBACK YOUR VIDEOS:,* Press the Green Play Button,* Use the Right/Left Buttons to find the Video you wish to view,* Press the Func. Set Button (Play Movie will be displayed in the Function Menu),* Press the Func. Set Button again to play the Video,* Use the Up/Down Buttons to control the volume during playback,NOTE: To exit Playback Mode for both Pictures and Videos, press the Shutter Button to exit out to the Camera LCD screen (Ready Mode).,DELETING PICTURES AND VIDEOS:,* Press the Green Play Button to enter Playback Mode,* Use the Right/Left Buttons to find the Picture/Video you wish to delete,* Press the Trash Can Button,* Use the Right Button to highlight ERASE,* Press Func. Set Button and follow the prompts,NOTE: To erase multiple Pictures/Videos do the following:,* Press the Green Play Button to enter Playback Mode,* Press the MENU Button,* Use the Down Button to highlight ERASE...,* Press the Func. Set Button,* Use the Down Button to highlight one of the following options:, - SELECT - Allows you to pick the Picture(s)/Video(s) you want to erase (Use the Func. Set Button to select them then press the MENU Button and follow the prompts) NOTE: Use the Right/Left Buttons to move through the Images., - SELECT RANGE - Allows you to select a range of Pictures/Videos to erase, - ERASE ALL - This will erase EVERYTHING on your SD Card that is unprotected (This is the same for the above two (2) options),WARNING: Please pay attention and follow the prompts to avoid deleting files that are unprotected - you can not get them back. If you want to protect your Pictures/Video, please do the following:,* Enter Playback Mode by pressing the Green Play Button,* Press the MENU Button,* Use the Down Button to highlight Protect...,* Press the Func. Set Button and follow the prompts,OK folks... That's the Canon PowerShot ELPH in an nutshell. I've uploaded a short video showing the location of the above mentioned Buttons.,[...]","February 22, 2017",4.0 out of 5 stars,Ozarks Airgunner

B019UDHT6U,Canon-PowerShot-Digital-Camera-Stabilization,Canon PowerShot ELPH 180 Digital Camera w/Image Stabilization and Smart AUTO Mode (Red),"While this camera is cheap and has a reliable brand name. It is like the base model camera where even the steering wheel has been made optional. There are several issues with it:,1. Camera just won't focus. It is also near impossible to take picture of a picture because it won't focus.,2. Cannot take panoramic photos,3. Cannot turn-off eye redness check which results in 'too much light' on close objects.,4. Flash can be either turned off or made to go automatic. But it cannot be set to always ON. So you cannot take clear picture inside of a house if your camera does not think that it is dark enough to require flash.","April 21, 2017",3.0 out of 5 stars,Eric Cotton

I had to call people up and also fumble connecting the memory card to the slip in sleeve....you do not show in the picture how the piece slip's inside the other piece. The battery loader photo is accurate. The memory card big chip and memory card small chip are not shown how they fit together. Why is that?? It is the most important load and the lock, or memory lock seems un--necessary. Why have that? Anyway, if you show the picture simply....we will not have to look stupid....asking our friends?? Obviously, if you show the picture and use a color photo all the stupidity can be eliminated; ok.

The interface is very intuitive, so you can learn and grow into it as you go along. I've had it for several months now and it is a pleasure. Really like the handle, so you can really get a grip on it while shooting. (A left handed alternative might be a good idea.) The lens zooms into subjects nicely as needed. Only downside is the manual lens cover. Grew spoiled by auto-retracting lens covers over the years.

Returned the camera to Amazon for credit.  A few days later I was in a Target Store, near the Electronics Section , saw another model 830.  The sales clerk asked if I was interested in the 830.  Related my previous experience—he configured the camera to print date on photos, we tested it to insure it would.

It fits great into my pocket for bike rides and other outings when I don't want to use my phone and risk dropping my phone or draining the battery.  The picture quality is pretty good, I thought it would be better considering it is 20 MP.  I haven't had the camera long but can't seem to find settings to adjust lighting and outdoor back light. Also, the camera is so small, which is great for carrying around, I find that when I push the button I move/push the camera down causing a slight movement in the camera.  It almost feels like a toy.

B00I8BIBCW,Sony-DSCW800-Digital-Camera-Black,Sony DSCW800/B 20.1 MP Digital Camera (Black),"I'm not sure why this camera is getting such glowing reviews. As a point-and-shoot for daytime vacation photos, this camera is perfectly serviceable. At nighttime, or under any kind of ""challenging"" conditions (such as a concert), the camera is SLOW as molasses to take pictures, and the pictures are often washed out or out of focus. On vacation in Europe I took (no joke) 50+ pictures of the Grand Place in Brussels at night, and NOT ONE came out decently - all were extremely grainy or horribly out of focus, or both. However, pictures I took with my cell phone came out fine (given that it was a 5MP camera on a $79 phone). Also, pictures I took with my GF's *cheaper* Canon P&S looked fine. So it's not entirely me. I also took this camera with me to a recent CHVRCHES concert: despite being less than 30 feet from the stage, the pics I took with this camera are AWFUL - the pics taken with the 8MP camera on my (new) phone look a hundred times better. It's almost as if the firmware is somehow ""off"" on this camera or something. All I know is, this is my fourth digital P&S camera, and this is the worst one BY FAR - even the godawful HP digital camera I owned back in 2002 took better low-light pictures than this camera. Also, the battery latch has a nasty habit of popping open in my pocket, something that's never once happened with the HP and Canon cameras I've owned in the past.","June 28, 2016",2.0 out of 5 stars,J.

I tried the camera for basketball and soccer and maybe got 5% useable pictures, the rest were blurry. I kept going back and reading directions and trying different settings. And yes I used a tripod as well (which did help and got the rate up to 15%). But even half of my ""portrait"" pictures were out of focus and blurry.

Even at ISO 100 and 1/125,  the image has terrible noise giving the appearance that the image is out of focus. Chromatic aberrations are present at every setting. Nothing is sharp, regardless of conditions and regardless of ISO, SS, aperture.  Low light setting defaults to 1/30,  but,  the flash does not produce a hot enough light to focus the subject.  Terrible camera.  I am a professional who wanted a little pocket camera to take photos of friends at an event. I had low expectations and this camera did not even meet the lowest possible standard.

I did my research before I bought my first long zoom camera.  I have had Nikon, Canon, Fuji. All are well made and do what you would expect. But this Lumix FZ70 is over the top good. I have not even tried all the features yet. Basically I set it to auto everything and I'm just loving the images I'm getting. Will be taking it on our Europe trip later on this summer. Just a quick example: Last week during the full ""blood moon"" we had a great view of it here in California. I put the camera on a tripod, set the zoom to 100x and waited. When it went into full eclipse I touched the shutter button. Because of the low light it automatically took a series of 7 or 8 shots. I could hear it during the process. The aggregated image was spectacular. The blood moon effect was awesome. I put it up on FB and received many kudos for the shot. I'm very pleased with my purchase. Way to go Panasonic.

B00I8BIBCW,Sony-DSCW800-Digital-Camera-Black,Sony DSCW800/B 20.1 MP Digital Camera (Black),"Just received this camera in the mail, and I'm very disappointed. Sony's w800 Digital Camera  feels very cheap and poorly constructed. I feel like if I drop it once, it will crack or become dysfunctional. The quality of the pictures are horrible! My smartphone takes WAY better photos than this. I bought this camera because I wanted something that took higher quality pictures than a cellular phone, and this purchase was a mistake. Also, within 15 minutes of playing with this camera, it would not read my memory card. I can't believe this product has so many positive reviews, because it is a piece of junk.","February 3, 2015",2.0 out of 5 stars,CrazyCatGuardian
B019UDI5PO,Canon-PowerShot-Digital-Camera-Optical,Canon PowerShot SX420 Digital Camera w/ 42x Optical Zoom - Wi-Fi & NFC Enabled (Black),"I came to Amazon looking for a camera to take on vacations and trips. I only ever use my iPhone for pictures, and wanted to invest in something slightly more professional that wouldn't break the bank. I am in no way a photographer, but this camera sure makes me feel like one. It's the perfect size for travelers, as it fits in your hand perfectly, as it's very small and portable. I think the picture quality is absolutely stunning. I can zoom into a tree from over 100 feet away and it looks as if I'm right in front of it! I haven't taken this camera on my trip to Europe yet, but will update and post the pictures I take once I do. I've mostly just played around with it, taking pictures of my dog or sister. I included a selfie to show the flash - that was taken in a pitch black room. I wasn't even sure it would come out clear, but wow! Look at the quality!,One thing I would like to address is the wifi, which might be my favorite thing about this camera as a whole. I contemplated buying the Canon powershot SX410, which is a cheaper, slightly older version of this camera, but opted for this because of the wifi feature. I can't boast about it enough. I can take a picture of something, click on the wifi option on the camera, connect to the wifi from my phone, open the free camera app and send the picture directly from my camera to my iPhone. I can also delete that picture from the camera once I've saved it to my phone, so I'll never run out of space! The battery life is also very impressive and it seems to stay charged for a long time (another reason it's great for travelers). And the time it takes to fully charge the battery isn't long at all.,I'm just a person who wanted a cool camera to take nice quality pictures. I'm not a photographer or anything near, but I love clean, crisp quality shots. If you want a small, portable camera that takes AMAZING quality pictures, has a KILLER zoom and flash, and has a wifi feature that allows you to share your pictures on social media in the matter of seconds after taking the picture, this is for you. This camera should be so much more expensive that it is because it's absolutely amazing. 10/10 recommend!","August 2, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,Martha A. Jungenberg
B019UDI5PO,Canon-PowerShot-Digital-Camera-Optical,Canon PowerShot SX420 Digital Camera w/ 42x Optical Zoom - Wi-Fi & NFC Enabled (Black),"I don't have a lot of photography or non-phone camera experience. So, I really just jumped into the DSLR world with this camera. Having this for a week, I really enjoy it for how much it can do.,Seems like a lot of the reviews here are people that don't understand how cameras work (ISO, aperture, shutter speed). You DO NOT have full control over aperture or shutter speed. It's an entry level camera. If you want full control, buy a Rebel T5! The specs are not professional either (they're mid-range at best), so don't expect your quality of pics to be super awesome starting out, you need practice. This camera is a tool, you have to control it. It's not going to take great pics by itself!,Here's a few of my favorite pics I've taken in the past week. Enjoy! :)","August 1, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,J
B019UDI5PO,Canon-PowerShot-Digital-Camera-Optical,Canon PowerShot SX420 Digital Camera w/ 42x Optical Zoom - Wi-Fi & NFC Enabled (Black),"When I first received this camera, I wrote a  review saying I loved it. The photos were super sharp, and the zoom was amazing. It's so easy to use. However, now, a few months after I received it, it suddenly broke. One day, I used it and everything was fine; the next day, for some reason, the zoom lens wouldn't retract and a message popped up telling me to ""restart the camera."" I had not dropped the camera. I kept it in the camera bag, and had no reason to think it had suffered any trauma. I tried multiple times to restart the camera, but it didn't help. I called Canon, and they suggested I send it to them. Instead, I found an authorized Canon dealership nearby. They saw the camera was still under warranty, and took it in for me to send it themselves to Canon. Today, I was informed that Canon will charge me $93.20 to repair the camera because, they say, the lens is not under warranty. The camera store told me that the lens is the most vulnerable part of the camera. Needless to say, I am very disappointed.","July 31, 2017",2.0 out of 5 stars,Grandma Susie
B019UDI5PO,Canon-PowerShot-Digital-Camera-Optical,Canon PowerShot SX420 Digital Camera w/ 42x Optical Zoom - Wi-Fi & NFC Enabled (Black),"The canon power shot sx420 is a neat little “point and shoot” camera. Great focal length (see chameleon and fork pictures) good zoom that stays clear and doesn’t get grainy. This was a gift for some one who thought they might like to get into photography but doesn’t understand terms like iso.,I think this will be a good camera for a beginner as it allows you to change picture resolution, light and focus while looking, but has a feature where it tells you the photos info so you can understand.,Usually a Nikon fan but same price range you can’t get wifi enabled- this has WiFi - and it works well! You need to dig a bit to find the camera functions and not everything is as intuitive as I’d like, but I would say overall very good.,Compact size makes a big difference for this camera. It’s very light and handles well.,Night mode is fairly good- husky photo was low light. You need to figure out the settings with in the mode- but it’s doable.,I took away one star because with everything it DOES do, you should be able to do more outside of the “auto” mode.

B019UDI5PO,Canon-PowerShot-Digital-Camera-Optical,Canon PowerShot SX420 Digital Camera w/ 42x Optical Zoom - Wi-Fi & NFC Enabled (Black),"At first I was thrilled with this camera because the wi-fi features worked right out of the box.,This impressed me. I was quick to review and give it a high rating. I was too quick.,Week after week I started to notice that the shutter speed was too darn slow.,If a subject moves or twitches even the slightest bit, there is a blur.,Canon support, to their credit, is quick to respond, but the suggestions they offer do not work.,There is no setting that seems to impact the shutter speed (even the ISO setting.) It seems the shutter opens for almost a half to 3/4 of a second.,The only pictures that come out decent are ones taken indoors with the flash.,But using bright, available light or exterior bright light yields way too much motion blur.,I bought this camera to show my daughter how a real camera compared to her phone camera.,I lost that argument. Despite the high megapixel feature and big lens... the pictures are really poor. Grainy and blurry.,They other problem is the camera can't focus when fully zoomed in. Maddening. Try to take a picture of a distant object and adjust thefocus while zoomed in; Blur.","December 31, 2017",2.0 out of 5 stars,Steplander

B019UDI5PO,Canon-PowerShot-Digital-Camera-Optical,Canon PowerShot SX420 Digital Camera w/ 42x Optical Zoom - Wi-Fi & NFC Enabled (Black),"First I bought a Coolpix which had wifi. I never could get the wifi to transfer pics to my iPad and the camera was too small and the controls too close to each other to operate the camera. After I found the Coolpix a new home, I bought this Powershot SX420.,First, the camera is large enough to hold still and to operate the controls. I have arthritis, my hands are a little stiff but I can use this camera without any problem. The thumb rest beside the movie button didn't stop my thumb from sliding, so I put a small square of sticky back Velcro there to use for a thumb grip. Problem solved.,The wifi is very easy set up. Pictures transfer painlessly to my pad or the photo printer.,The long zoom makes the SX420 a great kayaking camera. Pictures of wildlife along the shoreline are very clear.,This is a great little camera to have fun with when you're tired of your big camera that seems to take itself so seriously.","August 10, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,Cheri W

Only had it for a few days, but am impressed as is my wife who has a Canon 6D with a couple $1000 lenses.  Bought this so we could just take some decent easy everyday shots without lugging around my wife's camera.  What I've observed so far is that the flash is great!  It actually makes pics look better rather than washed out and over exposed.  The zoom is AMAZING.  I get amazing detail and pictures from a hundred yards away.  Took it to the San Diego Zoo and got best pictures ever of multiple animals like I was 5 ft from them.  It also focuses great!  The pics are sharp and crisp.  So far the camera has been pretty intuitive, but I'm going to have to break out the manual for the burst mode.  Can't find it.  Also, not sure how the aperture priority vs the shutter priority works.  Wife tried to explain, but this will take some reading on my part.  I'm below an amateur.  The only real things I have to compare to are two different Nikon point and shoots I tried previously.  The Nikons provided a blurry picture and the zoom didn't focus making it unusable.  If you're looking for near DSLR quality at a good price, size, and weight I definitely recommend this camera.  I'm contemplating buying another one for my wife who really likes it as well.","May 28, 2015",5.0 out of 5 stars,John Michael Koehler II

It takes really good pictures and video outside with sunshine but takes very poor pictures inside unless there is a MASSIVE amount of light. The flash is kind of wimpy and objects behind the subject are grainy. The mic picks up even the slightest bit of wind so forget about hearing people talk if the wind is really blowing. It even picks up the breeze from a ceiling fan indoors.The WiFi keeps losing connection with your smartphone and it is a pain in the a** to keep connecting.When you do connect you can only take still pictures remotely but not video.You can't connect to a smart TV or a computer to use it as an on screen camera which really sucks.

I do, however, expect that it will take a decent picture.  I tested out the camera inside, outside, daylight, and in low light.  Each picture, no matter when taken or in what setting, failed to come up sharp.  With a Zeiss lens and at 20 mp, this camera underperforms my old Elph which cost $145, had a metal body, and took clear pictures all at 8mp.  Truly underwhelming, on top of adding a plastic body to the camera, giving it a cheap feel.,On the whole, a grand disappointment.","December 8, 2015",2.0 out of 5 stars,outwest

B00HNJWUBI,Sony-DSCW830-Digital-Camera-2-7-Inch,Sony DSCW830 20.1 MP Digital Camera with 2.7-Inch LCD (Silver),"Bought this as an upgrade for my Sony W330 (which is an outstanding camera). I do not notice any significant improvements; so no ""wow"".  The macro focus and the low light sensitivy appear to be comparable to the W330; these are 2 of its best features. The panorama feature is a little disappointing as it only captures appx 60 degrees and often ends up with misalignments between frames. I have much better luck using an SLR and photostitching software to create superior 360 degree views. At max resolution, the time interval between frames seems really long due to the size of the files. I considered reducing the resolution, but then what's the point - - might was well just use my W330. Still if you're looking for a very compact and very versitile point-and-shoot, I do recommend the W830.","August 27, 2014",5.0 out of 5 stars,tenebboy

Do not waste your money like I did on it. I only use Canon cameras, I owned the previous elph that lasted from 2011 until last year when my 2 year old accidentally got sand in it on vacation. Hence the purchase of this one as a replacement. I also own the Canon 7D, so I'm pretty sure if I can use manual mode on that but can't get this point and shoot to work, it's definitely a horrible product. Other sites have horrible user ratings but somehow I went by the ones on this that give it 4/5. It doesn't focus for anything and we found this out when I was in the hospital having our 2nd child and didn't want to use cell phones. I'm the only one who knows how to use my professional camera and I was having a baby, so I wanted something my husband and family could pass around. So very disappointed. Do not buy this product!!!

B019UDHT6U,Canon-PowerShot-Digital-Camera-Stabilization,Canon PowerShot ELPH 180 Digital Camera w/Image Stabilization and Smart AUTO Mode (Red),"Warning! No image stabilization! This is my 5th or 6th Canon powershot camera and they all used to have image stabilization, even the entry level cameras. I don't know at what point they took this away from entry level cameras, but this really affects picture quality. Luckily, I was able to get my ancient SD 1200 working again, which takes much better pictures even though it is MUCH older. If you are interested in this, I strongly suggest spending the extra $20 and going up a level, as that one seems to have image stabilization. IS really makes a difference in any indoor or darker environment. I wish I would have paid attention to this detail, but you never previously needed to. Be aware. I'm also bugged that this camera has fewer manual controls than older models of entry level cameras. Is it time to switch brands or start using my phone more?","June 9, 2017",1.0 out of 5 stars,D.

B019UDI5PO,Canon-PowerShot-Digital-Camera-Optical,Canon PowerShot SX420 Digital Camera w/ 42x Optical Zoom - Wi-Fi & NFC Enabled (Black),"I am an artist who needed a simple new camera for my colorful artwork (and for personal nature hike photos). I have used the camera for a couple of weeks now (still figuring out some of the settings), but I am super happy with it so far. The color seems good, the zoom works well (though can be a bit grainy on super large shots). I shot the moon photo the second day I had the camera. I am really pleased that the self-timer will remain ON from shot to shot instead of having to re-set every time - very handy! The length of the lens takes a bit of getting used to, but I do like the way this feels in my hand compared to a rectangular point-and-shoot. The largest image resolution is HUGE and will yield crisp prints at a smaller size. I am very glad I ultimately chose this Canon PowerShot SX420 out of the literally dozens of cameras I researched over a month's time! (Photos: I bumped up saturation in post editing on the close up of the 1 "" and 2"" crystals, the moon was shot on a tripod (I never shot the moon before, so that was an exciting result).","March 25, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,Creative Lady

Stabilization, Touch Enabled 3-Inch LCD, Wi-Fi, DC-FZ80K (Black)","The reason I gave this 4 stars is that this is a great little camera for those who want to move into the more advanced photography than allowed by the simple point and shoot ones.  It takes wonderfully sharp pictures and has an easy override for the exposure.  It has quite a number of photographical effects that would take large camera bag filled with filers and gadgets to accomplish in a film camera.  The viewfinder is a lot more comfortable in taking pictures than the screen at the back of the camera which is prone the washing out in bright light.  One feature I especially like is the ability to set the view finder so that it is overlaid with a horizontal and vertical lined grid.  This not only helps with composition but also for aligning vertical structures for architectural photography and also keeping the horizon level.  I have nearly the same view screen in two of my three film SLR’s,A minor complaint I have is that the camera lens reverts most wide angle zoom mode when first turned on.  I would prefer it to start with a more normal view of around 3x to 4x zoom.  It has a lens resume option, but that takes it back to the zoom position last used when the camera was turned on.,A not so minor problem is that it takes nearly three hands to plug the mini USB adapter into the camera.  One to hold the black camera, one to hold open the little black access door, and one to insert the little black mini adapter into the black opening of the black camera.  Night vision glasses and a third hand could be very useful.","October 29, 2014",4.0 out of 5 stars,D. Thayer

Stabilization, Touch Enabled 3-Inch LCD, Wi-Fi, DC-FZ80K (Black)","Owned for a few weeks now. Used almost exclusively for nature photography, ranging from close ups of insects to distance shots of birds.,The FZ70 does many things well: it has a great zoom, the buttons for control of the features are easy to reach, even when your eye is pressed to the viewfinder (after a bit of practice), and has enough stabilization to allow sharp, handheld photos at full optical magnification. The manual focus control isn't nearly as good or as quick as a ring, but will get the job done if your subject will stay still. It's not a macro camera by any means, but I've been happy with butterfly photos taken far enough away to not startle the insect.,That being said, comparing to my partner's Canon SX50, a few limitations have made themselves clear. The first, and most obvious, is the difference in digital zoom. Pushing the magnification beyond the optical limitations, the FZ70's quality deteriorates much, much more rapidly than the Canon. For distant shots of eagles, the Canon still looks crisp while the FZ70 becomes fuzzy. This holds for both for automatic and for various manual settings. The screen and viewfinder also aren't quite up to par, which makes determining perfect focus or reviewing photos a bit more of a challenge.,At the time of this review, the FZ70 is also $100 cheaper than the Canon SX50, which certainly played into my purchasing decision. It is a very good camera, but I wouldn't say it's the best in its class.","June 19, 2014",4.0 out of 5 stars,Kyle

Takes great photos, but you do have to spend time learning the function mode settings. I feel that the ones offered: tiny camera, monochromatic, pinhole are all effects that you can easily add while editing your photos on the simplest photo editing sites. You cannot quickly add the effect, take a shot, then get rid of the effect. In fact, it is hard do get the camera out of the mode and back to reset. The most useful modes are macro and fish eye lens. Again, it takes some thumbing around to access those modes. Jury is still out.","April 8, 2016",3.0 out of 5 stars,Leafpeeper

B019UDHT6U,Canon-PowerShot-Digital-Camera-Stabilization,Canon PowerShot ELPH 180 Digital Camera w/Image Stabilization and Smart AUTO Mode (Red),"I cannot stand this camera. I have had two Canon Powershot's before and loved them.  My last one just broke so I decided to buy this one before we went to Disney Land so some days I wouldn't have to lug my big Nikon DSLR around with me.  This model was a huge let down.  It had a slow response time, so when the camera finally did fire the people had already walked out of the frame. It wouldn't shoot rapid fire for mulitple frames and it had very poor low light capabilities.  I finally just gave up using it and got better results with my iphone by far.

B019UDHT6U,Canon-PowerShot-Digital-Camera-Stabilization,Canon PowerShot ELPH 180 Digital Camera w/Image Stabilization and Smart AUTO Mode (Red),"Although a negative review I'm not here to just complain but hopefully help others make a decision. I'm not a pro wedding photographer, but I am an experienced photographer who has owned a variety of cameras over the years and I take the time to read features and instructions for each camera to get the best result. I picked this camera up a year ago for its small size, high MP and brand name. The amount of time it takes this camera to focus is simply disastrous. I have used numerous settings to take photos of sporting events, subject up close and far away. Blurry every time. If you are taking still shots in excellent natural light, you can get a decent photo. Under other lighting conditions, terrible! Night or low light? forget it, nothing comes out clear. Sports or moving objects - 1 out of a thousand will come out clean. Fact is I purchased this camera to get better pictures than my phone, turns out the phone easily beats this cheap toy from Canon. Again, i'm not a shaky handed novice photographer so trust me when I tell you, don't purchase this camera, go up to a higher level camera or stick to using your phone. Sony Cybershot cameras in the $150-$200 range have delivered the highest value to me over the years, this is what I'm going back to for a simple Point and Shoot.","February 15, 2018",2.0 out of 5 stars,Gerald A.

B019UDI5PO,Canon-PowerShot-Digital-Camera-Optical,Canon PowerShot SX420 Digital Camera w/ 42x Optical Zoom - Wi-Fi & NFC Enabled (Black),I've had this only a few days and glad I have it.  I bought it to take pics of the total eclipse of the sun on Aug. 21.  I've been aiming it at the sun - WITH APPROPRIATE FILTER -  and the 1000 mm lens is  tolerably good.  Blue Bonnets in my back yard 75 yards away are very sharp. Haven't been able to shoot the sun yet.  I have used a Canon AE-3 and a pair of 500mm mirror lenses for a number of years and this camera seems equal to them.  It is extremely light weight and very easy to operate.  One thing I dislike intensely about all digital cameras I've seen is a lack of a facility for a cable release.  With a 1000mm lens a cable release seems indispensable. So far that is the only drawback of this camera.,"April 25, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,Little Tex

B019UDI5PO,Canon-PowerShot-Digital-Camera-Optical,Canon PowerShot SX420 Digital Camera w/ 42x Optical Zoom - Wi-Fi & NFC Enabled (Black),"I bought the red one for myself and absolutely love it.  I find the stabilizer works well and my pictures are sharp - mostly photos of people in casual settings.  After 6 weeks I bought a black one like it for our office and while I think I have set the settings the same I am not sure the pictures are as sharp!  Maybe my eyes have gotten worse (a possibility as I am awaiting surgery) or maybe there is a glitch in the second camera.  The original reviews showed some significant variation from 'clear sharp photos' to 'not happy with clarity of photos'  -- so maybe the black one has some issues as I am same photographer now trying a second one for our office.  Again, I love the red one I got first and stabilization/clarity of photos was one of the main reasons I chose this camera.  I only purchased the second for our office after practicing/testing the first one for 6 weeks.  The jury is still out on the 2nd purchase (a black one so there is no question which is which!)","September 30, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,Sue Anderson
B019UDI5PO,Canon-PowerShot-Digital-Camera-Optical,Canon PowerShot SX420 Digital Camera w/ 42x Optical Zoom - Wi-Fi & NFC Enabled (Black),"Both pond sample pictures were taken hand-held through a double-pane window about 35 feet from the subjects.  The turkey vulture picture was taken through a double-pane window, hand-held and about 175 feet away.  Those who complain about picture quality are doing something wrong.  I now own two of these cameras--almost instant on so you can capture great shots.  The amazing thing is the equivalent 35mm camera focal length on the lens is 1,000 mm when in pure optical zoom.  Inexpensive, fast, great picture quality and fantastic image stabilization--no tripod needed.  If you're looking for great flash, you're looking at the wrong camera.  I know a thing or three about cameras and photography; simply, you don't need to know anything to take great pictures with these.  You can remove the SD card or hook directly to computer with USB cord.  Apparently Wi-Fi is another feature which I haven't attempted.

B019UDI5PO,Canon-PowerShot-Digital-Camera-Optical,Canon PowerShot SX420 Digital Camera w/ 42x Optical Zoom - Wi-Fi & NFC Enabled (Black),"The camera itself takes good pictures, but then most cameras these days are just as good.,This review is about only copying pictures from camera to Computer. Not dumb, stupid, and weak smartphones.,Once you get the camera configured and connected to your Wireless network:,1. You have to press camera wireless button to connect.,2. You start the program on your computer to either import all or copy what you want.,3. You *can not* take pictures while connected to the computer.,4. On the camera now you have to disconnect from wireless, in order to take more pictures.,This is completely unusable, it would be just as easy to take the SD card out of the camera and copy the files, or use a USB cable connected to the camera/computer.,People don't care about cameras, people care about the pictures and copying pictures where they want them.,1. Getting pictures off the camera to a Computer is poor, it works but very inconvenient.,2. The defunct company Eye-Fi had this working better than any company I have found (ten years ago).,3. I never tested the Cloud based upload, nor the smartphone features.,For those of you who have never seen or had an Eye-Fi wireless card: The process of getting pictures to your computer is incredibly simple:,1. Just turn the camera on and shoot pictures, a hundred if you like. The pictures just show up on your computer, without any interaction.,Eye-Fi (now defunct), Originally the software for the eye-fi sucked just like all the rest as it was CLOUD based. But the final software they released (because they shut down their cloud service), was designed to connect to your computer directly using WiFi.,It worked flawlessly.,-Cheers","July 31, 2019",3.0 out of 5 stars,Tymer Top Cat

B00I8BIBCW,Sony-DSCW800-Digital-Camera-Black,Sony DSCW800/B 20.1 MP Digital Camera (Black),"I bought the Cybershot model DSC-W230 many years ago. It is still going strong, although it developed lens dust/spots, which isn't unheard of for cameras. I bought the DSCW800 because I use these cameras for work, and worried the older one would give up, and wanted to have a replacement before I needed it.,Although this newer model has some advantages, one disadvantage is that the W800 has a difficult time focusing when recording in video mode, something the W230 never has a problem with. It doesn't matter what one is taking a video of, and under what light conditions. It just doesn't want to stay in focus very well. Eventually it will focus, but even if the camera is in a static position, it will go in and out of focus.,It took a long time from order to actually receiving it, which I didn't mind because I really like Sony products, but am disappointed that focusing and staying in focus is really makes it undesirable for taking video. Takes great photos though.","April 4, 2017",3.0 out of 5 stars,CV Rodberg

B019UDHT6U,Canon-PowerShot-Digital-Camera-Stabilization,Canon PowerShot ELPH 180 Digital Camera w/Image Stabilization and Smart AUTO Mode (Red),"I have had this camera for a little over two weeks now and I can honestly say that is it a great camera if you are on a budget. With 20 mega-pixels this camera takes extremely clear pictures and amazing video (at 720p HD). The small design of this camera is great for taking trips and just placing it in your pocket.,BATTERY LIFE:,For the short amount of time I have had this camera, I cannot say too much about the battery life. I charged the battery when I first purchased the camera and have not had to recharge it since. Being a YouTuber, I shoot a lot of video and have used this camera on average 2.5 to 3 hours each day since I purchased it. I also take a lot of pictures with this camera (I have a dog who likes to sleep or sit in very odd positions), but again, I have not had to recharge since the first time.,20 MEGA-PIXEL & 8X OPTICAL ZOOM:,As stated previously I take a lot of pictures, and with the 20 mega-pixels this camera provides the pictures come out very clear and almost perfect. I say almost perfect because while it does take clear pictures the Smart AUTO feature does cause some problems if you are not taking pictures in idealistic settings.,With the 8x optical zoom I have noticed is not as good as other point and shoot cameras. Again this will depend on if you are shooting in idealistic settings, but on this camera it unfortunately does make the photo a little pixelated if you are trying to zoom in. Having taken a variety of pictures with the camera I have to say that unless you are shooting with extremely good lighting, the zoom on this camera should not be used past half of the full feature.,SMART AUTO:,Smart AUTO is honestly a great feature on this camera because you do not have to program your camera for every situation. The Smart AUTO feature does use 32 predefined shooting situations to determine the best settings for that specific shot, however, it does have its problems. The main issue with the Smart AUTO feature is that if you are taking pictures in less that ideal situations, the camera might choose settings that basically ruin the picture. For instance, when taking a picture of my dog at a dusk setting out in my backyard, the Smart AUTO feature chose the settings of an indoor close up shot. So while this is a great feature be prepared to run into some issues.,CONCLUSION:,While this camera does have a few flaws I do honestly believe it is an amazing point and shoot camera. All of the features do take some getting used to just like any other product out there. I would highly recommend this camera to anyone who has a budget they need to stick with but still wants a great camera for either pictures or video.","November 21, 2017",4.0 out of 5 stars,Joseph
B019UDHT6U,Canon-PowerShot-Digital-Camera-Stabilization,Canon PowerShot ELPH 180 Digital Camera w/Image Stabilization and Smart AUTO Mode (Red),"The camera itself is good, but I have two complaints. The wrist strap comes separately and is extremely difficult to attach. I was unable to do it. A previous camera in this line came WITH the wrist strap attached. Why not this one? The enclosed info booklet had such small print I needed magnifying eyeglasses PLUS a large magnifying glass to read it. And then it had little info of value other than FCC rules. To find operating instructions, I had to go to the Canon website where I had to download a manual that previously came with the camera. The manual was a staggering 216 pages! Previously the manual was a manageable 4 or 5 pages.","August 31, 2017",3.0 out of 5 stars,Steve

B019UDHT6U,Canon-PowerShot-Digital-Camera-Stabilization,Canon PowerShot ELPH 180 Digital Camera w/Image Stabilization and Smart AUTO Mode (Red),"Meh.  Lightweight, old-style camera.  Does not auto-focus, so you have to practice using it before you take pictures.  I am annoyed that the description does not explicitly say that it does not come with memory chip or USB cord, so I had to buy these separately.  It also doesn't explicitly say that it does come with charger for the battery, so I was keeping my fingers crossed, and I am glad it does.","March 15, 2016",3.0 out of 5 stars,Adornable

The ELPH 180 takes nice photos, but the case is cheap plastic. I will be fortunate if the cover for the battery/card compartment lasts a year. When I take photos I usually take the card out and put it in the computer, but I will not be able to do that any more. Instead I will have to use a mini USB cord. Yes, it is that flimsy.","August 20, 2017",3.0 out of 5 stars,tmtrvlr
B019UDHT6U,Canon-PowerShot-Digital-Camera-Stabilization,Canon PowerShot ELPH 180 Digital Camera w/Image Stabilization and Smart AUTO Mode (Red),"I am so disappointed in this camera. I have always been a Canon girl and was looking for a replacement of the camera that I keep in my purse, my previous camera had reached a point to where the lens cover was not closing all the way, but it was several years old. With the new camera most of my shots are blurry or have a glare in them. So disappointed.","June 22, 2017",1.0 out of 5 stars,Karen L
B019UDHT6U,Canon-PowerShot-Digital-Camera-Stabilization,Canon PowerShot ELPH 180 Digital Camera w/Image Stabilization and Smart AUTO Mode (Red),"Poor quality photos.  After 5-10 photos it stops focusing properly even in daylight and in high contrast scenes.  After ruining many photos of events important to me, I finally learned that I have to turn it off occasionally so it can reset itself.  It would be nice if there was a firmware update to fix that.  Most lower-light photos are unacceptably grainy and out of focus because the camera seems to default to increasing ISO rather than operating the flash.  I think I have defeated that feature by finding the menu selection to force the ISO to 100 or 200 rather than letting the camera set it.  Even when operating at what I think is its best, colors seem dull.  I tried setting the colors to ""vivid"" and they turned out unnatural and with an orange cast.  Still experimenting with settings, but so far this is a big disappointment compared to my previous Canon pocket camera.","September 15, 2017",2.0 out of 5 stars,drm_sandiego
B019UDHT6U,Canon-PowerShot-Digital-Camera-Stabilization,Canon PowerShot ELPH 180 Digital Camera w/Image Stabilization and Smart AUTO Mode (Red),"I bought an Elph 180 in August and took it straightaway on a major PCT SecJ backpacking trip (7 days). It was by far the lightest, most compact camera available at short notice, and I had had the previous model (2016) - and killed it using it in rain (photos recovered from SD Card)!!,Online reviews had dissed the Elph 180 battery life as limited to 220 per charge, so I started out rationing the number of photos I took daily, and with flash disabled.  However 5-6 days into the trip, the battery was still reading FULL, and I had taken over 150 mountain,  views, flower shots etc, so I let loose.,Total of 220 shots later (coincidence) it still read full and we reached civilization, with a bunch of GREAT photos - only issue was the wildfire smoke limiting the visuals.,I love this camera - but will now always keep it in a ziploc baggie on wet days.,Let's fix global warming!!!","September 2, 2018",5.0 out of 5 stars,Richard Menzies

Stabilization, Touch Enabled 3-Inch LCD, Wi-Fi, DC-FZ80K (Black)","This is a great camera for the level just below the SLR.  It does not allow lens to be changed but it has a very wide range for zooming.  In fact the tele is so long that one must use a tripod unless it is in the brightest of light.  The zoom feature is on a toggle switch and not like SLR which would be on the lens.  Therefore, it is a little slower to change focal length.  The glass monitor is pretty large and bright.  The pictures are sharp as you should expect.  I am no connoisseur, just a hobbyist so I cannot give you a very sophisticated review on the optics.  Be aware that this camera, unlike many Lumix camera, does not carry the Leica lens designation.  On the other hand, that really isn't that important these days, from what I hear.  All in all, it is a versatile camera for those wanting a little more than a point and shot with a goodly wide range from wide angle to zoom.","February 25, 2014",4.0 out of 5 stars,Wine Teacher

No eyepiece.  In general daylight, with 50+ year old eyesight, this ... isn't good.  The screen resolution may be great, but basic daylight will give you no idea what the camera is actually seeing, light, polarizing, focus- wise.  I LOVE my SX50HS and thought, this is smaller, has wifi etc - how can I lose?  Let me tell you - you do.  I almost simply returned it - but have decided to just use it as an inside function camera. Set it on auto,  let the kids use it at parties and you get great photos.","November 26, 2017",2.0 out of 5 stars,CindyG

We usually use our iPhones when we travel for photos but the quality is never as good as Apple advertises unless you want to spend hours photoshopping you pictures. Yes this is an older model but if has great flexibility as it takes high quality photos and will record video in full 1080p HD.,There are plenty of presets to point and shoot a variety of photos as well as full manual control for the more advanced photographers.,There is a long list of accessories that come in this package and I won’t go into them.

B00HNJWUBI,Sony-DSCW830-Digital-Camera-2-7-Inch,Sony DSCW830 20.1 MP Digital Camera with 2.7-Inch LCD (Silver),Bought this camera for my wife for our vacation to Utah. She took hundreds of great pictures. We had some enlarged and the quality of the photographs is excellent. This is a excellent camera that you can carry in you pocket and have ready in seconds. We bought a spare battery as she takes a lot of pictures. That worked well as we needed it. If you don't take a lot of pictures one battery will certainly work. We recharged both batteries every night and were ready to go every morning. When all is said and done - the pictures are what remains to remind you of those special moments. And this camera takes great pictures. This is the second Sony camera of this size we have purchased. I got her old one and it still works well - but this one is better!,"August 27, 2014",5.0 out of 5 stars,Randall

This camera produces huge pics - but at 180 dpi at best.,Combined with the need to get out the card reader, remove the card and put in the card reader every time I need to download photos (I usually take 1-2 photos at a time so this is close to every photo) rather than just plugging in as with the prior camera, it is quite inconvenient.,I thought I was getting a camera that takes higher resolution photos and I did not.

I wanted a small camera that I could carry at all times, with a descent optical zoom and not pay to much for. Picture quality is great for this size of camera and it is very easy to use.Has some great settings on it to get some cool effects and the video quality is brilliant. I transfer pictures straight to my IPad.Which means I can put pictures straight onto FB or send pictures to friends and family straight away.

She's having a grand time taking photos. We bought an SD card for 10 bucks to store the photos on; I'm not sure the camera would store them without it. Since it isn't marketed for children with a colorful kid-proof body or built-in games (which I really didn't want), it feels like the grown-up item that it is. It's easy enough to operate without reading the manual although some of the butttons are tiny and hard to see without reading glasses. The pictures are clear. I'd even recommend this for an adult who wants a basic camera with few frills.","July 6, 2019",5.0 out of 5 stars,Alex Martinez.

To be fair to the company, shipping was much faster than expected which was great since I purchased this for my impatient 6 year old. However, quality of the product is FAR below the reviews. The camera is very cheaply made and feels like it’ll break in your hands at any moment. There is a switch on the side of the camera that changes between close up and scenic views that feels like it’s going to break the whole camera every time I use it. The camera never focused for any image (I’m experienced with photography and couldn’t get it to focus) and after fully charging the battery for over 15 hours it died after only 3 pictures. I would strongly urge you to reconsider purchasing this product and go with a better known proven point and shoot. For the time being my 12 year old Olympus point and shoot is still a significantly better option for my son and I’m disappointed that I even gave this a try.","July 22, 2019",1.0 out of 5 stars,MMS

B019UDHT6U,Canon-PowerShot-Digital-Camera-Stabilization,Canon PowerShot ELPH 180 Digital Camera w/Image Stabilization and Smart AUTO Mode (Red),"I *CANNNOT* recommend this camera.  The day after purchasing the Canon PowerShot ELPH 180, I was taking pictures in a museum with family.  Everything was going well and it appeared the camera was pretty good (I left everything on the factory settings).  Every now and then I'd review the pics I took.  Then at one point in the day the camera suddenly gave a 'memory card lock' error and wouldn't take any more pictures.  I was also unable to review any pictures already taken.  I figured maybe it was feature of the camera that once you hit the memory card limit it would 'lock' the card or something.  So I didn't worry as I figured the pictures were still there and I could just transfer them onto my PC or Mac.  When I got home and tried that, both my PC and MAC didn't recognize the SC card.  Nothing.  Zip.  Not only did I lose all of my pictures but the camera fried the SD card to the point that it isn't recognized anymore and can't be reformatted.  I had some IT folks check the card out too thinking maybe I was missing something and they also confirmed, after trying two separate machines, that the SD card was ruined.  The SD card was only three months old and had been working perfectly until used in the camera.  Needless to say, I returned the camera and am very disappointed.  I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS CAMERA and would give it zero stars if I could!","December 11, 2016",1.0 out of 5 stars,Lincolnite

I own 2 other Canon Cameras (Rebel and 7D) so I had faith that this would be an easy, good quality camera. I returned this item after using it for 4 days. I tried it in low light (poor quality, difficult to focus, blurry) and daylight (over-saturated, but not terrible), and shade (difficult to focus, slow). If I were taking photos only of outdoor, well lit subjects, this camera would be fine for someone who wasn't going to edit or resize the photo.  Also, the focus on the camera is not in the center. Even when I was taking a portrait, with the subjects face taking up 70% of the screen, the camera would still chose to focus on the top left or right of the background.

For that, it did an acceptable job, although I wish it had an even greater wide angle capability.  Resolution is more than needed, so no problem with that, but the lens was not as crisp and sharp as I had hoped for.  But what can one expect in a low-price point-and-shoot camera?  For top quality pictures, I use other cameras, but I didn't have one with interchangeable lens capability, and could not afford to get what I really wanted.

The pictures are credit card sized and are actually pretty cool because you can fit them into your wallet, but just as easily combine them for a collage or scrapbook or something. Every single place I've brought this thing, it's been a hit, and people love taking instant pictures that they can carry around with them everywhere. Almost like a portable photo booth. The only downside to this camera is that if you use it a whole lot, the film packs can get pretty expensive, and they sort of fluctuate on pricing from time to time.
