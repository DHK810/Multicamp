B01MS16V42,PANASONIC-Megapixel-20-1200mm-Stabilization-DC-FZ80K,"PANASONIC LUMIX FZ80 4K Digital Camera, 18.1 Megapixel Video Camera, 60X Zoom DC VARIO 20-1200mm Lens, F2.8-5.9 Aperture, POWER O.I.S. Stabilization, Touch Enabled 3-Inch LCD, Wi-Fi, DC-FZ80K (Black)","I was really skeptical of getting this camera for my sister. She had a cheap Nikon Coolpix point and shoot and she took some fantastic pictures with it that really impressed me, especially when using the zoom. It broke the other day after like three or four years and I figured it was time for her to upgrade. Since she did not want a DSLR because she wanted to keep it simple, I researched many bridge cameras, but their picture quality left a lot to be desired. She loved the zoom on the Nikon Coolpix P900 but I detested the image quality of that camera, especially for $500. Not this one. While OBVIOUSLY not having the image quality of a DSLR, it is fantastic for coming from such a small sensor. Not only that, but the colors of this sensor are faithful and have a lot of pop, which remind me of my Canon EOS-7D.,Honestly, my Panasonic Lumix DMC-GH3 does not have these lovely colors at default settings. What else to say about the FZ70? Its sensor has surprisingly good dynamic range. Oh, the shutter release lag is minimal. There is none of that cheapy point and shoot lag. No waiting for a photo to be captured. After locking the focus by half-pressing the button, the picture is taken as soon as you press it fully. As soon as I took the first picture, I smiled so wide, because I was not expecting such DSLR-like behavior. Click. Sharp picture. Click. Another sharp picture. And that was in low light. SO SATISFYING., I'm telling you, it's a FUN camera and I NEVER felt the desire or even thought, ""I wish I had my DSLR with me."" I would be content having just this camera for a day without anything else. The zoom is not super fast in terms of speed, but come on...for less than $300, that would be too much to ask. The lens is SUPER WIDE, and it is respectably sharp even when zoomed fully, and I did not see chromatic aberrations when shooting a sunset. Ah, funny thing: even in VGA mode, the video quality is impressive. The camera has like 200 MB internal memory, so it can only record VGA. But it looks so good in camera, my sister and me started laughing. This is coming from me, a guy used to fast DSLRs and who would not be caught dead with a point and shoot. But not anymore, because this FZ70 is AWESOME. It even records RAW files if you happen to be allergic to JPEGs. How cool is that? Enclosed are snapshots testing the colors...and handheld moonshots...one at max zoom and one at less zoom. All are on Sunset scene setting. Thanks for reading. God bless you greatly!","June 11, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,CIMC7
B01MS16V42,PANASONIC-Megapixel-20-1200mm-Stabilization-DC-FZ80K,"PANASONIC LUMIX FZ80 4K Digital Camera, 18.1 Megapixel Video Camera, 60X Zoom DC VARIO 20-1200mm Lens, F2.8-5.9 Aperture, POWER O.I.S. Stabilization, Touch Enabled 3-Inch LCD, Wi-Fi, DC-FZ80K (Black)","Pros:,The zoom is truly awesome in this.  No SLR lens can compare.  It's great for birdwatching, zooming in on a face in the crowd, wildlife shots, and even just cool stuff that's a long way away.,4k video is great.  I'm a Canon SLR person and they don't have 4k in the low or mid-range for an SLR, so that's why I got this and it is great.,Fast FPS.  The camera can take 4k video, which is 8mp at 30fps.  It claims it will do it in 4k Burst mode, which really means it takes a 4k video and will show you frame by frame and let you select ones to make photos.  Horrible to do on the camera's screen, I wound up getting software that would do it on my PC and just pulling all the images out.  Which you can do from any video, so this is an ineffective feature (at least for me).  I wanted something that would create 30 images/second, which I could go through on a real screen and post quickly.  As this feature is why I chose the Lumix over a Nikon, I'm a little annoyed at their implementation.,Cons:,Low light conditions for moving subjects are awful.  To the point that you will have low light issues in places you didn't realize were low light, and there is no ""action"" choice on the selector.  The F2.8 for the lens in wide isn't matched by a very sensitive sensor, or it's not automatically upping the sensitivity as needed.  I have a ton of blurry shots of my kids because of this.  I've played with the light levels and it is cludgey at best, completely ineffective at worst.  I've hit a sweet spot a couple of times by setting it to 1/60th of a second, but it still has issues (and my kids aren't that fast).  This is an AMAZING outdoor daytime camera, but for kids in a bounce house it doesn't work for me.,No Focus Ring, so obstructed zoom is hit or miss.  Generally, zoom and autofocus are fantastic and FAST.  This means that taking a picture of wildlife that is partially obstructed by a branch means that you may get a fantastic shot of a leaf instead of the Pileated Woodpecker you were trying for.  Also, since the aperture only goes to F-8, there's a limit to how much depth you can get so that crystal clear leaf may only be 6 inches closer than the woodpecker, but, oh well.,Very limited options on the selection wheel. They've got the fab 5 (auto, P, A, S, M), then Expressive (for filters), Portrait, Panoramic, C? (maybe custom, but defaults to 1080p/60fps), and then Video (for adjusting settings in video mode),My last complaint is the smallest, the features (like C above) are poorly explained on screen (aperture is only ""A"", which isn't useful to noobs), which means that Panasonic style features are not understandable to people with more experience.  I accidentally turned on the feature of take 3 shots and merge them which doesn't work for kids moving (but would be great for landscape shots).  Missed 1/2 of my kids' Karate class trying to fix it instead of taking pictures.,Overall, this is an AWESOME camera if you are taking zoomed pictures or videos in sunlight, or of non-moving subjects.  The autofocusing on a leaf can be annoying, but survivable.  The wifi, etc. is nice but not particularly useful for me.  I have tested it and it'd be great to put on a monopod and use your phone to selection shots in a crowd.  And for $300, no SLR can compare on value.  However, once Canon comes out with the T8i, if the 4k is good, I'll likely put this on craigslist.  Because of the crappy low light, I still use my Canon T4i if I'm going somewhere like the Baltimore Aquarium or Natural History Museum with my boys, and this camera should have put my T4i to bed.","June 29, 2018",4.0 out of 5 stars,John Roberts
B01MS16V42,PANASONIC-Megapixel-20-1200mm-Stabilization-DC-FZ80K,"PANASONIC LUMIX FZ80 4K Digital Camera, 18.1 Megapixel Video Camera, 60X Zoom DC VARIO 20-1200mm Lens, F2.8-5.9 Aperture, POWER O.I.S. Stabilization, Touch Enabled 3-Inch LCD, Wi-Fi, DC-FZ80K (Black)","I've only had the camera for three days. I have to admit that the selection and menu choices were overwhelming at first, even with some familiarity with cameras. Panasonic has some features unique to its brand and learning the terminology took some time. Rather than read the online manuals, I watched some of the tutorials available on You-Tube. I found 16 dedicated videos by Graham Houghton on the use of the camera. I'm about a quarter of the way through. The claims that the camera doesn't perform in various conditions just don't seem to hold any weight when one learns how to operate the camera properly, especially the claim that it performs poorly in low light. I took the camera to the hockey rink and shot in the lighting available in sports mode and was able to capture some great shots. I played around operating the camera in different modes outdoors and shot a hummingbird in flight at 1/8000 of a second, freezing the bird's wings in flight. Admittedly, the lighting was not in my favor from my vantage point but it was just a camera test, not an attempt at a prize winning photo. I took numerous photos of the same dahlias in different modes and ended up with a series of totally different interpretations of the same image.,I also operated the camera at low light, using the setting recommended in the videos. The results were outstanding. I've yet to explore many of the camera's other features such as post focusing and operating the camera remotely with my android cell phone.,I shot over 330 images at the hockey game and still had half battery life left according to the display. I have not tried the camera in movie mode since I seldom shoot video. From what I've experienced so far, I believe my photos will well exceed my current exposures. I've barely learned the basics of the camera's capabilities.,With the huge amount of creative control, this is not a camera you can set down and then pick up a month later and remember how to operate all of its features. And even then, a quick review of the camera's manuals or the videos may be necessary if all of the camera's potential is to be used.,While some camera fanatics may complain about the camera's sensor size or some indistinguishable lens aberration due to the camera's long lens, let's face it, most of us will never have our photos printed as wallpaper murals. We view our creations on our cell phones, tablets, laptops, and TVs. The images created by this camera can be as stunning as any full SLR with thousand dollar lenses and are limited only by the shooters capabilities, not by the camera's limitations.,A nice feature that many bridge cameras do not have is a threaded front on the lend for filters. The shooter can add a polarizing filter or ND filters to extend shutter times to take specialty photos.,If I had one negative thing to say, I would have appreciated a tilt screen since, when traveling and standing in crowds, it is sometimes helpful to hold the camera over everyone's heads and shoot down at a high angle, using the tilt screen to focus. I can live without that one feature given all of the other features of this incredible camera.","November 1, 2018",5.0 out of 5 stars,JerryInLodi

Stabilization, Touch Enabled 3-Inch LCD, Wi-Fi, DC-FZ80K (Black)"," I've had this camera for a little more than a year and use it constantly with very good results for Facebook images. I typically use the autofocus to make the shots and reduce the default circa 5K JPEG images to about a third of the original size for posting.  I've had worse luck posting video, mostly because of a very slow Internet connection that makes uploading video of any size too time-consuming to be worth the effort. From time to time I use the very fiddly so-called manual focus with a tripod for pictures of flowers, etc., with varying results.,You get unbelievable value for the price, but still you are getting what you pay for--20-1200 mm zoom, RAW images (requiring a ton  of post-processing and correction for vignetting, etc.), sort of HQ video (very useful for documentary purposes, but not for filmmaking),  surprisingly good macro capabilities (focus at 1 cm), and decent color rendition.  I like my colors a bit oversaturated, and use the Happy setting for most shots (sorry professionals).  De gustibus etc.,The 1200 mm equivalent zoom is not terribly useful unless you have a reason to photograph large objects covertly from a distance in broad daylight. It hasn't helped me at all with birds on the Potomac and I reckon that for most subjects you wouldn't want to use more than half of that zoom in good, bright daylight. Still the lens is very flexible and gives you a terrific choice of FOV for everyday subjects.,The aperture is only five point something at full zoom--not the greatest--and the tiny sensor yields a softer focus across the board that you might expect--softer and noisier, IMHO, than some cellphone and pocket cameras of comparable size. Low-light performance is pretty bad, but the camera is far from useless in low light.,On the other hand, the 20mm wide angle is very useful both for interior shots and for photographing buildings. Add this to the surprising  macro capability and you get two very strong points in favor of this outfit.,There is a new and upgraded version of this camera, the DC-FZ80, which adds 4k video of TBD quality, focus stacking, two more megapixels on the sensor, (I think) an external microphone, and a few other substantial improvements.  Same old lens. Apparently no longer has in-camera memory (??). The early reviews suggest that the image quality is still a bit sub-par from a pro point of view, but the circa $400 purchase price definitely makes the new model a bargain, though not nearly as much of a bargain as this model.,There are a number of in-camera special effects filters, some of which are fun--though the effects are easily equaled or surpassed in Photoshop or The Gimp.,I probably won't upgrade, but would definitely consider the FZ80 as opposed to the FZ70  if I were moving today from a pocket-model point-and-shoot or a lens-limited cell phone.  The additional functionality might not justify the upgrade, but would definitely enhance a first-time purchase.,This old model is still a hands-down, amazing bargain as long as you know what you are getting.  If you are on a budget and are looking for a good learner-type advanced camera, you might well consider snapping up the FZ70 while it is still available.  I've had more fun with mine than a barrel of monkeys and it shows no signs of wearing out.,NB--the attached snapshots have all been slightly post-processed in an antique version of PhotoShop and reduced in size for Web publishing.  I include a raw video snippet from the Women's March.  Relata refero--judge not lest ye be etc.","March 11, 2017",4.0 out of 5 stars,Lafcadio Bumpus

Just Dont expect DSLR quality camera using good quality lenses., With good ilumination this camera takes great pictures.,This camera comes with a great software, just learn how to take pictures. Its not camera fault, my girlfriend always tells me that her phone photos sucks. But when I take them they look great.,To put an example. For portrait night pictures use the preset. Or use soft flash gain like in a DSLR. or use and external flash...,For night stars pictures use Starry sky to see the milky way.,For daylight portrait use P and use the flash(it helps with people skin),Anyways this is a great camera. Good battery.,Lets get real. A 20-1200 zoom is non existant in DSLR cameras.,You would need a Sigma that costs like your car., Do you need to print pictures over 12"" wide? Get a photographer with good glass and experience.,You get 20-1200mm with this plus optical stabilization.,One example. You are on vacation in the Caribbean. Do you get  a CANIKON with kit lens with 28-70mm(18-55) or a huge bag of lenses???? Or you get this incredible camera with 20-1200mm and almost 5 star rating on amazon. And get a grip. In tourist places there're professionals that take great pictures for cheap. At the end of the day you only need pictures for Social Media.

This camera has a very large zoom (which is why I bought it for) which is almost useless because to take good shots that requires high shutter speeds which in in turn require either very bright light or very high ISO values. The electronic image stabilization is not worth the powder to blow it up with. Other cameras do a much better job.

Stabilization, Touch Enabled 3-Inch LCD, Wi-Fi, DC-FZ80K (Black)","Initial impression: It's hard to believe what this camera's capabilities are until you've used one.  I have bags full of camera equipment including a Mamiya RB-67, Pentax 6x7, Canon 5D Mk2, Canon T2i and a lot of glass so trust me when I say, this camera lives up to the pre-release hype.  I originally had my sights set on the Canon SX50 which is a good camera, but falls short of its Lumix peer.  My focus was to get an easy to use point-and-shoot camera for my wife since the SLRs were just too much for her to handle - but now she's going to have to fight me for it.  I will update this review as I gain more experience with the video and special functions (which there are many) in the future.  Until then, I recommend you get one while the price remains well below $400 because I don't think it will stay their long when the word gets out how great this camera performs.,UPDATE: After using this camera for nearly 6-months, I am still VERY happy with it and the pictures it produces - and would be glad to share some of the shots.  I find the extremes between other reviewers ratings interesting since I have not experienced many of the negatives mentioned and have experienced most of the positive remarks.  This camera simply works for me.  I've shot everything from sports car road races to retirements to scenery with great success and carrying this 1 lb 7.2 oz camera sure beats the heck out of hauling my 12 lbs of 5D Mk 2, with dual battery pack and 50-500mm Sigma lens around all day plus a couple extra lenses and batteries in a camera bag.  I also have no trouble taking my shots to 13x19 inch prints from either RAW or JPEG format files.  I've also read this camera is big and bulky.  Well, if you wear XXL gloves like I do, it fits just right in my hands.  It also works much better in my wife's hands than the DSLRs we have (T2i in addition to the 5D)so she is happy too! The weight is simply not a concern to us as we've both carried it around all day without any problems or side effects.  In fact, now that the price has dropped to $249 I'm going to buy another one to keep peace in the family.,Several reviewers mentioned soft pictures at the 1000 to 1200mm end of the zoom range.  I'd bet your paycheck that most of the problem is camera movement since it is very difficult to hand hold any camera still enough at this extreme magnification to get a super sharp picture - regardless of image stabilization system employed.  I've had much better luck using a monopod or even better, a solid tripod (as one reviewer suggested) to get those very sharp long range shots.,I also discovered the automatic backlit scene sensing and exposure system when I moved to the fully automatic setting - very effective!,But as I said, the proof is in the final product so if you would like to see a sample of images - reply to this review and include your email address and I'll share a few with you.","September 5, 2013",5.0 out of 5 stars,JJ

(bought refurbished from Goodios here on Amazon).,The main reason I needed a new camera was for the optical zoom. We have a lot of ""flora and fauna"" in our yard and I like to take pictures of the various critters and plant life to share with family & friends. Obviously, I can get up close to plants and flowers, but the critters are another story.,The maximum optical zoom I have on any of my older digital & 35mm cameras was 3X - 10X, which just wasn't enough to get good quality images from the distance I needed, like 100 feet.,I took a chance on the refurbished model from Goodios on Amazon because it fit my budget much better.  Aside from a 90-day warranty, the only thing different from new and refurbished seems to be the box; the refurbished is shipped in a plain brown box, but everything is there that would ship with the new camera (CD, manual, lens cap, USB cable, shoulder strap, battery, and charger).,I'm still playing with all the MANY settings (automatic and manual) but so far, this is an awesome camera for the money.,It doesn't have Wi-Fi connectivity, like some of the more expensive cameras, which I was aware of and really don't need. So if that's something you want, take that into consideration.,It does have Panasonic PhotoFun software that opens up when the camera is connected via the supplied USB cable.,You do want to get an SD card (Micro SD w/ adapter). I picked up a 64GB SanDisk on Amazon for peanuts (compared to what they used to cost not so long ago). ,]  and it's working great!,If I'm out and about and absolutely ""need"" to send one or more of the photos on the SD card in the camera, I can remove the Micro SD and pop it into my Samsung Galaxy S5 phone to email or message (or any phone that accepts SD & Micro SD).,I've attached two photos that I actually did take early this morning. One is the non-zoomed photo (trees in our yard); the other is the squirrel that I zoomed in on in the same trees in the first photo.,Overall, I completely recommend this camera. If anything changes in my opinion, I will amend my review.","July 25, 2015",5.0 out of 5 stars,SoCal MBA

Stabilization, Touch Enabled 3-Inch LCD, Wi-Fi, DC-FZ80K (Black)","The zoom range on this camera is unbelievable.  The base camera has a 60X zoom range making it the longest of any camera available at the moment. The total zoom range in mm is 20 - 1200 mm which is very impressive. Standard SLR lenses with those types of ranges would require several lenses and untold thousands of dollars......plus the cost of the camera itself. Yet this Lumix jewel accomplishes all that and more at a scant fraction of the cost. The camera is easy to operate, has an incredible amount of built in features and much more just waiting to be discovered by experimenting.  An added bonus is the ability to extend the zoom range by selecting image resolutions less than the full 16.1M.  While there are those who will always want to shoot at 16.1M for me it is overkill.  Image resolution is a subjective issue. It is simply a matter of what you want to believe and are willing to settle for. I currently use a Sony DSLR compact camera like this Lumix, a Nikon D50 with several lenses but usually coupled with a Tamron 18 - 200. This D50 is a 6.1M camera and I have shot and enlarged flawless prints at 11 x 14 with total clarity. Some may take issue with this statement but excessive megapixels in a camera is much like owning a car that will run 150 mph when all you can go on the highway is 55 mph.  The capacity is there..........but when, if ever are you going to utilize it.  Now, if you are a professional photographer or a serious amateur and routinely enlarge to 16 x 20 or even 20 x 30 or more.....that is one thing. But if your basic need is for standard 4 x 6 prints and an occasional 5 x 7 or even an 8 x 10 then your eye will be hard pressed (if even able to) discern any difference between a 5M photo and a 16M photo.,I said all that to say this........one of the great features of this camera is the ability to increase the zoom range by selecting less than 16.1M resolution. I have taken it down all the way to 5M, still get crystal clear pictures and this increases the zoom range from 60X all the way to 270X!  Yes, you read correctly!!!  Then.....if you add the digital zoom you can end up with a total on camera zoom range of 675X.  Have you ever heard of anything like this?  Then for fun and games I took a Sony brand teleconvertor for my Sony that is rated for 1.7X and mounted it to my Lumix.  The standard filter size for the Lumix is 55mm but I had bought a Goja filter adaptor ring in order to be able to use my several hundred dollars worth of existing filters. Many of them are 58mm so I simply bought a Goja 55mm to 58mm adaptor ring and viola......instant filter availability. AND.....it just so happens that my Sony teleconvertor has 58mm threads and I was able to couple this right to my Lumix, which now takes the 675X max zoom of the camera with izoom and digital zoom, multiples it by 1.7 and now gives a total zoom range of 1147X.  That is NOT 1147 mm.............it is 1147X zoom range.,Now.......I will admit, the camera is a bear to use in a hand held mode, but that is just what I did to see worse case scenario. I am going to post a couple of pictures taken hand held at these extremes so you can just see the potential this camera offers.  My, my......we are almost talking spy type pictures from 10 miles off. I will let you judge the photos........not for clarity or subject matter.........but just for an example of the zoom range of this camera.  I will say this here........the bus in the photos was roughly 500 feet from my position and all photos were taken hand held from the same spot.,But even without the impressive zoom features......this is one heck of a camera. The pictures, even at 5M are crystal clear and will be certain to please. Then with all the built in special modes, the 11 or more internal filter modes, the 23 or so scene selection modes, and full manual mode with shutter or aperture priority mode.........you can go any route that you need for your shooting needs.,Another feature I like about this camera is that while filming a video you can press the shutter button and take a still photo. Or while viewing a video you can take still photos from the video. I am anxious to experiment with this more as I have a son in the band and I usually take multiple cameras to their concerts, etc. in order to video it and also take some still shots. With this camera I am hopeful to be able to do both with one instrument.  We have the first White Shoe rehearsal this Thursday and our first football game this Friday.  It will be a time to see what this camera can really do with its zooming ability from up in the stands.,In closing, as a camera buff of many years (40+) I am well pleased with this purchase. I have had a Pentax SPII, a Pentax ESII, a Nikon N70, a Nikon D50, several smaller point and shoot type all in one cameras and now this Panasonic. For ease of use, range of features and cost vs ability......I put this Panasonic Lumix at the top of the pack in features.  No, it does not have the quality that either the Pentax or Nikons do.....but then again..........this camera cost a fraction of what they did and some of the individual accessory lenses I have bought for them in the past cost several times the cost of this camera............so it is not even a fair comparison. But for features...........my expensive toys cannot begin to compare with the ability of this camera. I am well pleased with it.  To see the zoom range please look at some of the photos I am going to upload.","August 25, 2014",5.0 out of 5 stars,TheWaldo

The quality of the pictures are acceptable but not outstanding. I had expected more sharpness from a 20 MP camera, and less noise in the low light pictures. However, this is a low price camera, and is great for snap shots. The small size makes it easy to carry around, and the 32GB memory card can hold several thousand pictures. The memory card must be taken out of the camera and placed in either the USB cradle that is part of the deal or a designated port on your computer.,I give the product 4 stars only because of the picture quality and the lack of charging and transfer possibility without opening the camera to remove battery and/or memory card.","June 10, 2017",4.0 out of 5 stars,Jens

The Camera is quite small at 3 ½” wide and 2” tall and about ¾” deep.  It does have many features when taking pictures.  I typically use it to take pictures of smaller items a light box.  It does take very nice pictures and I have figured out how to make it work for my needs.  Settings are easy to change although they are small and hard to read and I must use reading glasses to see them.  Buttons are quite small as well.  For my purposes, the megapixels per picture are reduced, the flash is turned off, and I set a timer to a 2 second delay.  The camera does take pictures very quickly.  It does have a Macro feature that works well, however, make sure you are very close to the item before taking the picture.  I find that it is sometimes easier and quicker to get a clear picture of a mark using normal settings and then use picture editing software to crop and enlarge it.,Transferring pictures to your computer is simple and there are several ways to do so.  I use a cord connected to my computer directly to the connector on the side of the camera.  One neat item in the bundle is a USB type reader that has 4 slots (2 on the side and 2 on the end) that can be used to import pics from the memory card or other means.,The battery holds a charge well and is very easy to change.  Setting up the camera and getting started is very easy.  I had the camera up and running in about 10 minutes.,The bundle comes with many items.  The small tripod is handy.  The case is very small and just large enough to hold the camera.  The charger and accessories will not fit in the case.  Frankly, I only use the Camera, Charger, Memory Card, and Battery.  I keep the tripod and USB Reader available and do not use any of the other items.,Overall, the Camera is easy to use and takes very nice pictures both close up and normal.  It is a very good camera for the price.","November 10, 2018",4.0 out of 5 stars,G. Swanson

Ugh. My immediate thought was to have a camera shipped by Amazon to our first stop. That worked perfectly, but considering what I was willing to spend I had to consider our options carefully. My main objective was to free us from the necessity to use our phones as cameras because I was looking for better battery life, more zoom capability, and ease of download to my laptop. Although this is a very tiny camera, it met those objectives. In fact, the ease of download greatly exceeded expectations with the flash drive transfer process. The camera has everything included, is easy to use, and produces reasonably good photos. I will leave the technical discussion of photo quality to the more avid photographers, but we are pleased. This will be a camera that accompanies us easily when we don't want to drag along the higher end photo gear.","August 27, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,Rappers Mom

B019UDHT6U,Canon-PowerShot-Digital-Camera-Stabilization,Canon PowerShot ELPH 180 Digital Camera w/Image Stabilization and Smart AUTO Mode (Red)," I do professional photography for a living but wanted a small pocket camera for hiking/traveling/walking and quick things around the house without dragging out a bunch of equipment. It fits in a pocket perfectly! I don't know about you but if I take my pro gear out on a walking, I never actually get any exercise, I just stand around taking photos in one or two spots the whole time. Lol. So — my view on this is it's not as good as previous point-n-shoots I've had. They used to be heavier, more sturdy, better made and less expensive. This one is lighter, tad flimsy, pricier than I'm used to (for the low quality) and not as good made. Comes with a rechargeable battery which is nice but I don't love it enough to buy a backup, although it does last a very long time, charged it for the first time after 2 months of use which is about 10mins every 3 days or so. Quality is so-so and many of the basic features and settings I'm used to on most other point-n-shoots are not on this camera or very limited. An amateur can take good shots with it but only if you have the patience on the focusing. It can take a long time for it to focus on what you are trying for. For example, say you are trying to get a butterfly on a flower, it may continuously want to focus on the ground rather than the flower/butterfly area (see photo of what I mean or looks like Amazon isn't allowing all my photos so not sure if you can see it). It does AMAZING macro shots most of the time though, it automatically focuses them (best without flash on) but other shots farther away or if trying to do something quick not as great, so give it time to focus. Not the worse quality shots ever but not best either. A tiny bit muddy/painted look if you zoom into the images at 100% (see photo of 100%). The video (one attached) is decent, actually does better than photo stills. It also does not turn off ALL sounds. The settings allow you to turn off many sounds but it keeps the shutter sound, beeps when focusing and there is no way to turn it off. Personally, I don't like the sounds. If I had to choose a pocket camera for hiking and traveling again, I would save a little more and not get this one. If I only wanted to take quick macros inside for products etc, this is the camera to have. I've attached 19 photos and 1 video straight from this camera without Ps edits. ~Happy Shooting~","June 12, 2017",3.0 out of 5 stars,C. H. Greene
B019UDHT6U,Canon-PowerShot-Digital-Camera-Stabilization,Canon PowerShot ELPH 180 Digital Camera w/Image Stabilization and Smart AUTO Mode (Red)," Okay. I gave it 5 stars because I love the camera itself and don't feel I should downgrade my review because of what the listing says. Also it wouldn't let me put in four and a half. But any buyer should know that the listing says that it comes with ""64"" of something regarding memory. It doesn't say 64 of what. Could be Kbites, could be Mbites, could be Gbites, could be raw fish or tooth faerie droppings. Who knows? Turns out there is ZERO. ZIP. NADA. So if you order one of these be sure to buy some memory because it is not included and the camera would be useless without it. Good thing I'm a bit of a memory hog and bought an ""extra"" or I wouldn't have been able to use it at all until I ordered some.,Another small thing that it won't do (and I hold Canon blameless for this) is that there is no way that I can find to put a live view from the camera onto my computer screen—as you would do with a web cam. I didn't buy it specifically to do this kind of thing so I'm not let down but I do a bit of astrophotography and that kind of thing is nice. The screen is too small to tell if there is dirt on one of your lenses in the dark. It ruins the shot if you don't notice it and when you are trying to shoot a picture of the full moon and don't catch it you have to wait at least a month to set the shot up again.,With those two things in mind it's a pretty good camera and I'm happy I got it. The screen is easy to read. It's got a lot of the features that you would expect to find on a more professional grade camera. The menus are fairly intuitive once you've spent fifteen minutes or so with the manual. I should be noted that you do have to download the manual itself because it only comes with a quick start guide. In Auto mode while shooting some pictures, like the moon for example, the exposure is a bit too high but I suspect there is a setting that would fix that, which I haven't found yet. In Program mode it's easy enough to correct that kind of problem, as it is pretty easy to take control of most of the other settings.,I shot the attached video of the moon through my telescope because a picture is worth a thousand more words.,I'm still experimenting with it because I just got it yesterday but I'll update this if I think of anything else.","August 6, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,Brett Ashton
B019UDHT6U,Canon-PowerShot-Digital-Camera-Stabilization,Canon PowerShot ELPH 180 Digital Camera w/Image Stabilization and Smart AUTO Mode (Red),"This point and shoot has been great to use and I have been quite satisfied with it considering its low price. I have attached test photos and videos so you can be the judge on the quality. I noticed that this camera is especially good at picking up accurate and bold colors in both the photo and video modes.,Canon includes a ""Getting Started"" guide, a warranty card, a small lanyard, a 680mah battery, an external battery charger (which is nice if you plan on buying additional batteries), and the camera itself.,With the popularity of smartphones, what is the appeal of this entry-level point and shoot camera? Well, unlike most smartphones, this camera features an 8x optical zoom. This is a great feature that allows you to zoom in decently close while experiencing a minimal degradation in quality. The camera's maximum video quality is 720p but it features quick auto focusing and as mentioned before, good accurate colors. The only issue that I had with the video quality is that the stabilization is not the best.,Conclusion: This is overall a great entry-level point and shoot and I do not think you will be disappointed for the price. The 8x optical zoom is definitely my favorite feature and the photo and video quality is about what you would expect for a camera in this price range. There is no included SD card so you will need to buy one, and there is no included transfer cable (mini USB) so you will also need to buy one of those to load the photos and video onto your computer unless you have an SD card slot. The user interface on the camera is easy and simple to use. This camera is great for those who are not extremely technologically savvy as there is basically no learning curve. Nice job Canon.,Disclaimer: I purchased this product with my own money for my own personal use.","February 24, 2016",5.0 out of 5 stars,Kevin Breeze
B019UDHT6U,Canon-PowerShot-Digital-Camera-Stabilization,Canon PowerShot ELPH 180 Digital Camera w/Image Stabilization and Smart AUTO Mode (Red),"I wanted a small, easy to use camera that could zoom for a trip to Scotland and Ireland.  The camera worked extremely well, though I never went past the 8x optical zoom.  I especially love the option to delay the shutter by 2 seconds in low light to prevent camera shake when pressing the shutter button.  Underexposing on stained glass windows (which otherwise looked all white) worked very well.,I bought a spare battery and recharger.  I took 1,050 pictures over 22 days, and only replaced the battery twice.  The spent battery recharged in 2 hours.,The only problem with the camera is the small cord, which I could not put around my neck.  Consequently, I dropped the camera on stone steps, and it got banged up.  It continued to produce great photos.  I took it to a camera shop, which gave me a long cord to attach to the camera's small cord, so I didn't drop it again.  However, the shop advised me that the tiny connections inside could have come loose, and the camera might not work after a few weeks.  It got me through the trip, and I will now buy another one to replace it.","September 28, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,Sacramento reader
B019UDHT6U,Canon-PowerShot-Digital-Camera-Stabilization,Canon PowerShot ELPH 180 Digital Camera w/Image Stabilization and Smart AUTO Mode (Red),"We take a lot of vacations and many photos for family albums.  Our two previous purchases were of Nikon Coolpix.  These inexpensive cameras tend to last just 2-3 years (which is fine, given how affordable they are).  When our Nikon died on us, we decided this time to upgrade and purchase the Canon because Canon has a good reputation.  But we are severely disappointed.  For one, the only flash control this camera has is automatic.  This means that if the camera detects light it will not use the flash, and you have no way of manually using the flash to override the automatic sensor.  Let us say you are taking a photo of someone and there is light in the background.  The camera will detect the light and not use the flash.  But you would want to manually have the flash go off so as to light up the face of the person.  The Nikon Cookpics were MUCH less expensive than this Canon yet did have the manual flash control.  Second, the picture quality is poor - surprising, it is of less quality than the cheaper Nikon.  And finally, we realize that these are cheap cameras but nonetheless, this Canon feels flimsy and ""plasticky"" compared to the Nikon.  You may as well buy the Nikon - you will be spending less money and have more quality.","September 17, 2018",1.0 out of 5 stars,William

If you’ve ever owned an ELPH camera, you know that they’re high-quality, ultra-portable cameras. Obviously you’re not going to get DSLR-quality images from a camera like this, but this is still a great camera, and if you use a tripod, you will be able to get excellent results. I use mine with an Amazon Basics tripod (which costs a little more than $20 and is really light and portable). Shooting with a tripod, even when using a little Point and Shoot camera, makes all the difference. But back to the camera. This is a great camera.

So many fake positive reviews about this camera here because very few of these raving reviews mention the horrible focus in their cons list.  No question the lack of focus must be at the top of any cons list.  I've missed thousands of shots because the lense wants to refocus every single shot, even after I've locked in a focal range & target to be focused on.  Like someone else here said:  This is a TOY.  Buy it if you have $300 to blow, if you have lots of spare time to waste waiting for it to refocus & refocus & refocus & refocus..., if you don't really care about getting that shot because you'll be disappointed a 1,000 times, otherwise it's not worth the frustration.

So I was eager to receive my recent order of a Panasonic Lumix FZ70 - but to be blown away by its performance and quality - who would have believed you could get the equivalent of a $1000 DSLR for less that [$]?My main purpose in ordering this camera was to have a digital camera that was light, easily portable and (most importantly) had a viewfinder. I have severe presbyopia and would be constantly taking off and putting on a pair of reading glasses to see the screen of my Samsung which was usually visually obscured by the ambient light of everyday outdoor shooting. This camera solves that problem as I hoped it would...but I discovered it could do so much more. I couldn't have imagined it possessed so many extraordinary features normally associated with only the most expensive DSLRs. Hand-held night photography? Check. Extreme macros? Check. In camera special effects? Check. And a zoom that has to be experienced to be believed (Check my photo in middle). Focus on a distant feature that literally can barely be seen from your current position and then slowly zoom out until you discover that it is so far away that in the full wide position of the zoom it has disappeared completely! Even has a ""hidden"" ability to make time-lapse video in the MINIATURE setting. Take pictures in reduced sizes for social media use or go full-blast RAW for Photoshop lovers. Be sure to download the full users manual PDF file for a course in this cameras many, many features.To the cameras amazing feature list  add an exceptionally protective and handy carrying case with internal straps that allow the camera lens to be cuddled by the case and leave room from the neck strap as well...and I scarcely need to mention that the kit comes with a 16GB high speed SD card. I am a confirmed addict of Amazon and this cements that relationship once again. I am SOOooo happy.","July 15, 2016",5.0 out of 5 stars,Mad Scientist

I have worked with Lumix before on a much higher end level, and their camera's are AWESOME.,When the camera is in decent to good lighting it works very well. Once the lighting starts to fade the quality almost instantly turns to pixelated garbage. During Christmas I was shooting some test footage of my family around the tree, and the results were terrible. Between the artifacts, pixelation and the camera having a hard time focusing I was very disappointed. I also was filming my black cat and the camera couldnt focus, couldnt translate the scenario. I grabbed my 80D to see if it was just a tough situation to focus on... but the 80D did just fine.,This camera should ONLY be used in controlled lighting or daytime ventures... this camera will probably be a great one for you, especially with the price. But if you are going to encounter darker rooms or places, shadows, low light environments... I would suggest getting a camera with a better lens than F2.8-5.9... and a system that can deal with low lighting better.","December 30, 2018",3.0 out of 5 stars,Jim Zuch

Stabilization, Touch Enabled 3-Inch LCD, Wi-Fi, DC-FZ80K (Black)","The LUMIX FZ80 for me is more of a video camera. While it takes very good pictures and has great capabilities in regards to manual settings, I think you'll find this to be more for video makers who also want to take the occasional high quality photo. The 4K videos are crispy clear, no upscaling or shady business there, it's a legit 4K video. The 1080p 60 FPS mode is my favorite for general filming though, combined with the powerful 60X optical zoom it really can't get much better than that. There's also the scarcely heralded slow motion video capture function which captures 720p HD video at 120 FPS, and it works really well.,Where the camera falters a little is it's features beyond those mentioned above. No external microphone input, no DC power input (only USB, you must run it off the small 895 mA battery), and no live video output (HDMI is only for playback of previously recorded videos and photos) put this camera in the ""beginner"" section for me. But this is where we are reminded of the price. You aren't going to find another camera capable of what this one is for this price. This is a bargain camera for those who wish to take a step up from pocket digicams or their cell phone cameras, and a very worthy candidate of being someone's long term main camera for Youtube or other minor video production.,All around the camera is built well and very intuitive to use once you get used to it's many built-in features. If you want to buy this and just put it on fully automatic settings you will probably not be disappointed as this camera has excellent auto adjustments both with photo taking and video.

Just a few hours of use per charge and the camera will not function with non-OEM batteries without the smart battery id/charge control chip. So buy lots of batteries and an external charger.

I love the simple options the camera has, and the simple explanations included on the camera, which make a switch to different modes very easy.  Truthfully, I've never looked into the options that my cameras have; I just leave everything on auto.  But the simple explanations which are displayed when you turn on the ""help"" mode make the options easy to navigate.  After fifteen years of using this type of camera, I finally have one where I feel confident changing the settings to increase quality of picture.  I still usually leave it on ""auto,"" though, and the quality is much better than most I've experienced.  The camera is very lightweight and compact, fitting better into my purse than most I've owned.  I just took a 6-day vacation in which I took over 800 pictures, and I only had to recharge the included battery one time on day four.  Plus, it's cute because it's red.,The only reason I didn't give this camera five stars is because the processing time is very slow though. The picture takes a couple seconds to process, thereby making it difficult to snap a couple pictures in quick succession.","September 13, 2017",4.0 out of 5 stars,Kimmy Kong

Got this based on the price and what I read in other reviews.  Have taken quite a few pictures with it on several vacations (mostly scenery) and am quite pleased.  It is easy to use, the zoom is all I need for my vacation pictures.  Battery life is great, love the color--lightweight, easy to use.  As long as it continues to hold up, I will be very pleased I chose this camera.","February 20, 2018",4.0 out of 5 stars,Lucy Ray
B019UDHT6U,Canon-PowerShot-Digital-Camera-Stabilization,Canon PowerShot ELPH 180 Digital Camera w/Image Stabilization and Smart AUTO Mode (Red),"This is a great little camera that takes nice photos.  I bought it to replace an similar older Canon camera which I had for 7 years.  The new Elph 180 camera is very similar to my old one and I could use my old USB transfer cable and I now have a spare battery (from my old camera).  I agree with other reviewers that it's bothersome that Canon doesn't include a USB cable with this camera.  And I also agree with other reviewers that it really is hard to rig up the wrist string because the hole for the loop is so tiny.  My old camera had a metal body and I was worried that the plastic body of the new Elph 180 would be fragile.  But, it seems to be pretty sturdy.  So, overall, I'm pretty happy with this new camera.  I've been using it for 2 months now and it works great.","January 26, 2018",5.0 out of 5 stars,Pat the cat

B019UDHT6U,Canon-PowerShot-Digital-Camera-Stabilization,Canon PowerShot ELPH 180 Digital Camera w/Image Stabilization and Smart AUTO Mode (Red),"We recently visited Rocky Mountain National Park with the grandkids. One was trying to take photos with a V-Tech kiddie camera. One was taking photos with her hand-me-down Apple phone. The quality of the kiddie camera photos was very poor. The camera phone photos were poor quality and hard to view or download. We let them take turns using our backup ELPH and they had a wonderful time, took a few nice shots, and made great strides as photographers just with a little fooling around.,The ELPH is so intuitive, the auto setting is so nice, the anti-shake is so effective, and the view screen is so big that this turned out to be a very newbie friendly camera.,Don't underestimate the beauty of digital. You could burn off the cost of this camera in film and developing on a normal film camera in one family vacation. This baby will hold a few thousand high quality digital photos on a normal, (say 16 GB), memory card. That's a lot of pictures of the inside of a backpack, hands, feet, the rear end of the family dog, birds, ants and Mom's elbow. But among those will be a few really nice candid photos of the family at play, and I have to say we had the best time in front of the computer monitor looking at all of the easily uploaded photos.,The camera is solid and will take a fair amount of reasonable abuse. The wrist strap is flimsy, but saves the occasional accident. After a few minutes of instruction and practice the kids were naturals with the camera. Over the course of a few days the quality of the photographs, in terms of composition, choice of zoom, framing, and the like, improved dramatically.,This turned in to a great family activity, and got the kids totally invested in the vacation. It helped them to learn how to look and to see. And the operation of the camera never got in the way.,So, it's beyond dispute that, technically, this is a fine product. But moreover, in terms of value for cost as a useful thing to own, this was a worthwhile and rewarding purchase.,Please note that I bought this item for my family with my own real cash money.","June 21, 2016",5.0 out of 5 stars,Pop Bop
B019UDHT6U,Canon-PowerShot-Digital-Camera-Stabilization,Canon PowerShot ELPH 180 Digital Camera w/Image Stabilization and Smart AUTO Mode (Red),"I have returned this camera.  I bought it as a replacement for my old Powershot SD1200.  I take a lot of bird photos, and the SD1200's maximum 3x optical zoom is inadequate for this purpose.  Unfortunately, even though the Elf 180 has an 8x optical zoom, every photo I took at 8x turned out to be fuzzy.  I am positive it is the optical zoom causing the problem, because I had turned digital zoom off in the settings.  (Digital zoom photos are even fuzzier.),I subsequently bought a more expensive camera, which has not yet been delivered.  I was going to keep the Elf 180 anyway, for travel use.  But then I realized that for non-bird photos, my old SD1200 takes photos that are as good (or better) than does the Elf 180, and also has more user-friendly controls.  For example, the SD1200 has a macro button on the camera, whereas the Elf 180 forces users to drill down through a series of menus to reach that function.","May 13, 2018",2.0 out of 5 stars,Joyce

And it does fit well.  But I do not agree that you can undo one snap and take a picture.  The case does not easily lift off - it has to lift up and the lens is in the way - maybe you are not supposed to use the lens cap?  Most designs (for other cameras) the snap is at the top of the lens and goes down - also it is just the part covering the lens that goes down.  Here 3/4 of the case lifts up - and then will really be in your way - if you can get it over the lens.  Also the case must be unscrewed to change the battery/memory card - you have to unscrew the case at the bottom - don't expect to do it quickly - if you run out in the middle of something you won't be able to reload before it ends.

You do have to disconnect the base to access the battery door but I don't see this as being a show stopper. The top cover attaches solidly to the button on the base and also protects the upper part of the camera quite well.

The camera worked extremely well, though I never went past the 8x optical zoom.  I especially love the option to delay the shutter by 2 seconds in low light to prevent camera shake when pressing the shutter button.  Underexposing on stained glass windows (which otherwise looked all white) worked very well.I bought a spare battery and recharger.  I took 1,050 pictures over 22 days, and only replaced the battery twice.  The spent battery recharged in 2 hours.The only problem with the camera is the small cord, which I could not put around my neck.  Consequently, I dropped the camera on stone steps, and it got banged up.  It continued to produce great photos.  I took it to a camera shop, which gave me a long cord to attach to the camera's small cord, so I didn't drop it again.  However, the shop advised me that the tiny connections inside could have come loose, and the camera might not work after a few weeks.  It got me through the trip, and I will now buy another one to replace it.","February 27, 2019",5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazoncustomer

B07KSXT9NH,GordVE-Digital-Backpacking-Cameras-Photography,"GordVE 2.7 Inch Digital Camera, HD Camera for Backpacking, Mini Digital Camera Pocket Cameras Digital with Zoom, Compact Cameras for Photography","This point and shoot has been great to use and I have been quite satisfied with it considering its low price. I have attached test photos and videos so you can be the judge on the quality. I noticed that this camera is especially good at picking up accurate and bold colors in both the photo and video modes.it includes a "";Getting Started""; guide, a warranty card, a small lanyard, a 680mah battery, an external battery charger (which is nice if you plan on buying additional batteries), and the camera itself.With the popularity of smartphones, what is the appeal of this entry-level point and shoot camera? Well, unlike most smartphones, this camera features an 8x optical zoom. This is a great feature that allows you to zoom in decently close while experiencing a minimal degradation in quality. The camera's maximum video quality is 720p but it features quick auto focusing and as mentioned before, good accurate colors. The only issue that I had with the video quality is that the stabilization is not the best.Conclusion: This is overall a great entry-level point and shoot and I do not think you will be disappointed for the price. The 8x optical zoom is definitely my favorite feature and the photo and video quality is about what you would expect for a camera in this price range. There is no included SD card so you will need to buy one, and there is no included transfer cable (mini USB) so you will also need to buy one of those to load the photos and video onto your computer unless you have an SD card slot. The user interface on the camera is easy and simple to use. This camera is great for those who are not extremely technologically savvy as there is basically no learning curve. Nice job it.Disclaimer: I purchased this product with my own money for my own personal use.","February 27, 2019",5.0 out of 5 stars,Roberta Steiner

There are a lot of folks out there who do an excellent job of providing that sort of detailed information. In fact, I read a number of those reviews and found them very helpful. My decision to purchase the Lumix FZ80 was based almost entirely on the long telephoto lens. What I got in doing so was a heck of a lot more than a great zoom. I couldn't be more impressed with the picture quality even when using it in maximum telephoto. Our home has a glassed-in porch that overlooks a lake, so most of the time I have the FZ80 set up on a lightweight tripod. Virtually all my picture taking is through the porch windows, and the results are stunning. I am continuously blown away at how sharp and bright the pictures are even when shot through triple-paned windows. The FZ80 is small, but not too small, light, and very comfortable in my hands when off the tripod. I love the FZ80 and highly recommend it for those like me who are rank amateurs but love taking nature and wildlife pictures. I realize that the FZ80 can do a lot more than what I'm doing with it, but I use it basically as a point and shoot camera and boy does it point and shoot.

There are many great features about this camera that I like for bird photography.,Amazing zoom-60x optical zoom,Stabilization- The stabilizer allows full zoom shots while keeping them steady,Control modes- aperture/shutter priority settings,Raw,Bursts- the ability to take rapid bursts of pictures is useful,Flexible focus- the focus locks on an object (such as a moving animal) and refocuses if the object moves,Function buttons- these can be very useful for changing settings quickly, there are several function buttons that can be assigned a certain setting change each,Touch screen-also useful for changing settings quickly and focusing on specific points, another useful aspect is for deleting pictures rapidly,Eye Viewfinder- great for sunny days or for saving battery,Those are features great for wildlife photography, but other features make the camera great for other types of subjects.","April 13, 2019",5.0 out of 5 stars,Jon R.

PowerShot cameras since 2000, my pastime exploring slot canyons and backpacking in the desert southwest means that my cameras die from ""sand inhalation"" way earlier than from anything else, so I had to buy a new point-and-click frequently. But this one ... is the low-low end of what I had used over the years. It feels cheap to start with, but is also a supremely lousy camera in low light conditions. Bottom line, after one week out there hiking, I ended up ignoring the camera, and only using the iPhone SE.

I have a complaint about it though, it has no port to connect a USB wire for picture transfer or charging. It seems that with constant removal of the Memory card and battery (requires supplied charger to be recharged) contacts on either the card or battery will eventually break, it would be much better if Canon added a port even if it required making the camera a little larger plus then they wouldn't be required to supply a charger, I would have given this tiny camera 5 stars if it had a USB connection. I have found the USB connector, it won't charge the Battery thru it but I can download pictures using a USB cable, sometimes ya just gotta read directions! Don't ecpect it to do more than the requierd point and shoot takes nice pictures at fhort distances but blurry at long range low light situations, focuas just goes where it wants to, a camera may even take better pictures in this situation.

This review is simply because I cannot get a reply out of their customer service. I purchased this camera last fall for my mom. I was having a friend build her a new computer, so had it shipped to him. So she didn't get it for several weeks. By then I could not return it, and it did not power on out of the box. So my friend mailed it in to a repair center after I found the correct one to mail it to on the Canon website. This was in October, and there is still no word. With my work schedule, I cannot sit for hours on hold waiting for someone to answer the phone. I am very frustrated at all of this and just want either the camera fixed or replaced so I can get it to my mom.

Takes some very good pictures but many not so good. Seems to be an issue with too much light being let into the lens so some pics look sort of ""flashed out"" even when taken outdoors without flash. Also doesn't seem to focus as easily and quickly as my old SX600. But, I suppose for the price it is okay.,Got this as an inexpensive option to replace my now broken Canon Sure Shot SX600 IS which I happily used for about 5 years. Was shocked to see the price had not gone down in that time, but up! So... money being short, I am giving this Canon Elph a try. Set up much the same as the SX600 so very easy to use right out of the box and the pictures seem of good quality.

Stabilization, Touch Enabled 3-Inch LCD, Wi-Fi, DC-FZ80K (Black)","I had to practice a lot to learn how to use this camera for it is more complicated than any I have ever used before.  Manual settings are available for almost anything I want to do, but I've had to refer to the digital manual a great many times.  This is no point and shoot camera, although it works great for that too.  I had much difficulty learning how to get macro photos without blurring, but eventfully got great photos. The macro-zoom is something I did not expect and I'm super-pleased with that.  I can adjust the lighting, color, focus and get almost any type of photo I want, though for general use I leave it at Auto-focus +.  I like to take photos of insects, flowers and birds, so the manual settings are of great importance to me.  I also wanted to do time exposures, and although I would prefer to be able to set long time exposures, the longest exposure in this camera did permit me to photograph the aurora borealis with the use of a tripod, and the touch-up function.  The 60x zoom is very useful to me and I've photographed quite a few birds already.  It is very difficult to hold the camera still at the 60x level, but using a tripod for a bird is impractical when they are moving around.  I have to take several hand-held shots to get a good one, but usually succeed.  I am very pleased with this camera and it is everything I hoped for.","April 19, 2015",5.0 out of 5 stars,Carroll Rudy

Stabilization, Touch Enabled 3-Inch LCD, Wi-Fi, DC-FZ80K (Black)","Pros:  Light weight bridge camera with super wide angle and ridiculous zoom.  I didn't have time to do a full battery of tests but I did test for ease of use, low light noise, macro, and OIS - I'm impressed with all of these.  The fact that this camera has a 20mm wide angle makes it worthy of adding to my equipment line up, I wanted something light for hiking so I bought the Canon SX280HS.  I'm marginally disappointed with that camera because it's slow and too noisy in low light but at the time of purchase I was pleased with it's zoom (25-500mm).  Four short months this camera was released and as it's the only light weight camera with a 20mm wide angle I just had to try it.  Despite the fact I can't just slip it into my pocket the FZ70 is very light.  I'm 6' tall and the palm grip doesn't strike me as overly diminutive so I can see myself carrying this around with out a strap and not experiencing hand cramps.,Despite reading a number of negative reviews, initially, I'm very pleased with the quality.  Low light for a 1/2.3"" sensor'd camera is better then I expected, in fact it's better then the SX280HS (same size sensor) I purchased just a few months prior.  The negative comments surround picture quality, I could not duplicate a scenario that yielded a photo of ""poor"" quality.  While the images are not perfect they are better, IMO, than other point and shoots and perhaps equal to prosumer options from say five or six years ago.,Cons:  Finding a bargain - This camera's price seems to be jumping around from the original retail price so be careful.  Thanks to the super zoom and the uninitiated's inability to get a steady shot there are plenty of these as ""used"" which are in fact open box.  Be sure to read the descriptions when sorting through the used vendors as some are missing accessories.  I purchased mine as ""used"" and it arrived with all accessories, repacked in the original box, fulfilled by Amazon Warehouse Deals for nearly 30% off the already on sale price.,Summary:  I consider myself an avid enthusiast.  I know how to use a camera in full manual, how to get a steady shot even with out OIS; in fact, I use a full size DSLR (5D mkiii) most times.  I will be using this for my upcoming vacation and leaving the bulky lenses and accessories for my DSLR at home.  I'll still take my jean pocket worthy Canon SX280HS with me but will use this for excursions and killing time on ship.  If you are looking for telephoto capability my recommendation is walk before you run - this camera is good but only if you are familiar with bracing techniques, manual ISO setting, and tripod use.  If you aren't comfortable with say, shooting in full manual mode go with a less expensive shorter range compact zoom.  Check DPReview's site for a great comparison tool.  IMO this camera is as good as it gets for size, zoom range, and low light quality.  Not considering the value of the total package this would be a good camera to have at any price point within it's class of capabilities so if it's not on sale don't mark it off your list.,11/22/2013 UPDATE:,Add some Pros & Cons:,Pros:  I've shot 354 photos, about 150 outdoors, some with fill flash and the remainder inside, most with flash.  I'm very impressed with the battery life, the display indicates I have full battery life remaining even after all that use.  My indoor use consisted of walking around at the convention center here in San Antonio for the Auto Show.  The cameras display stayed on for about 1.5 hours during the time I was taking photos.  Also I wanted to point out the OIS is amazing.  I shot most of my shots today, indoors, in manual mode most at 1/25th of a second some at 1/20th at ISOs between 100 & 400.  Hand held sometimes zooming up to 16 or 18x and the shots came out crystal clear.  I believe out of about 200 shots I may have had two that were not usable due to camera shake.  I don't believe I would have achieved this with my heavier 5Dmkiii with the 24-105mm with IS.  I did have to employ bracing techniques, holding breath, gently pressing shutter and using any railing I could find to lean up against, but no tripod or mono pod.,Cons:,Pano mode, while it works great, does not have a manual exposure control.  Indoors it forced me to use ISO2000 which leads me to the next con, poor image quality in low light.  I don't know if its a sensor problem or a compression issue as I was using jpg.  It's not terrible but even at ISO400 it's noticeable.  I had spend most of the day yesterday photographing my dogs between ISO 400 & 1600 while indoors and first noticed it but inside the house it's a bit darker then at an auto show.  I knew to try and avoid ISO800 but after today I'd say if you can get the shot somehow with a lower ISO setting, say 200 or the lowest of 100 you'll appreciate the results - so a tripod, mono pod, or bracing techniques are a must.,A side note regarding perception of the camera itself.  Last year I used my 5D mkiii at the auto show and I went unnoticed.  This year, with the FZ70, arriving early to the auto show I was approached by some of the presenters who thought I was the official photographer - go figure...,As soon as I knew I liked the camera I ordered a spare set of batteries and charger.  Considering how great the battery life is I sort of regret getting two extra batteries.","November 20, 2013",5.0 out of 5 stars,Paul S.

After using it for several days I gave up,  My Z47 is much better and has  everything I need except the RAW feature.  Because I was so disappointed I returned it.","February 20, 2019",3.0 out of 5 stars,lettledarlin
B01MS16V42,PANASONIC-Megapixel-20-1200mm-Stabilization-DC-FZ80K,"PANASONIC LUMIX FZ80 4K Digital Camera, 18.1 Megapixel Video Camera, 60X Zoom DC VARIO 20-1200mm Lens, F2.8-5.9 Aperture, POWER O.I.S. Stabilization, Touch Enabled 3-Inch LCD, Wi-Fi, DC-FZ80K (Black)","Update: 11/17/2014.  I have used the camera for several months now and love it.  I really like the zoom range of the camera from 20mm to 1200mm and it is my main daily carry camera.  It takes great detailed photos and the noise levels are very good.,The is going to be a quick review on the camera and I will add more as time goes on.  The FZ70 takes really good sharp photos, but hand held might be a problem in lower light levels.  I went out yesterday evening and took some shots hand held and they all came out blurry.  I should have paid more attention to the shutter speed.,The camera works fantastically in iA, which is the auto mode. I mainly use Aperture but was impressed with the auto settings.,It will go with a 60 second exposure in the Starry Sky Mode, which is under the SCN mode on the main dial.,The lens thread is 55mm so if you plan on using your filters from any other Pany camera, you will need a 55 to 52mm Step Down Adapter.  Amazon has them for cheap.  I don't think vignetting will be a problem using 52mm filters as the lens is way smaller than the filter threads on the camera.  Here is the 55 to 52mm Step Down Adapter.,The camera has no shutter remote cord jack, so a shutter release cable will not work.  My Yongnuo YN-560 flash will not work on the camera either.  It physically hits the camera flash housing, which is raised a little.  The answer to that is to use a wireless flash trigger with the Yongnuo Flash and that works fine.,Addition:  I looked at the Yongnuo flash again and it will fit on the camera, but it is a tight fit between the camera flash and the Yongnuo flash housing.  I modified the Yongnuo flash by taking some of the plastic off the flash housing where the camera flash is hitting, with a pencil grinder.  It doesn't take much, and it is right in the middle of the housing.  You could remove some of the plastic in the flash housing with sandpaper, but it would take longer, but will also give you more control of how much plastic you are taking off.  Now my Yongnuo Flash works perfectly on the FZ70 camera!,The video does not have a progressive setting.  Interpolated is the best you are going to get with this camera.,The FZ70 does not have a jack for a shutter release cable and does not have an infrared input either.  The camera has to be set to a timer delay within the camera for 2 or 10 seconds.  If it was a Sony or Canon, the timer is set and stays on till you shut it off.  Unfortunately this camera requires you set the timer delay for each and every photo.,The longest the camera will go on exposure under the Shutter or Manual Mode is 8 seconds.  In the Starry Sky Mode it will go 15, 30, and 60 seconds.,Like I said the lens thread is 55mm so your filters will have to be that size or use an adapter.  The camera will use a teleconverter with the DMW-LA8 adapter, which is not available yet.  Addition:  Those LA8 adapters are available on Ebay now.  They are being sold out of Japan though.  I had that happen with the FZ200 camera as well and had no problem getting one from a Japanese Ebay member.  There are several teleconverters that work well with this camera, but may not be needed as this lens rocks as far as zoom goes!,Update:  An aftermarket adapter is now available for a good price.,It will take Raw pictures, but no one is supporting the FZ70 Raw files yet.  It will come.  Added: I found that FastStone will support the Raw files from the FZ70 and it is much better than Silkypix, in my opinion.  Just Google FastStone and download and install the software.  It is free.,Upadate: Raw for the camera is now supported in Lightroom and Photoshop.,Start up time is very fast.  I was able to take a picture in one second after turning the camera on.,The focus button is on the top of the camera now.  The AF/MF/Macro button is on the right side of the LCD instead of on the camera lens.,One thing I have noticed with this camera is the noise, or should I say the lack of noise!  The shots I took at ISO 800 and ISO 1600 still look pretty good, and at ISO 100 noise is hard to find.,The camera will zoom to 60X (1200mm 35mm Equivalent) in the 16mp picture size.  Setting the picture size to 10mp will give you 75X zoom, setting the size to 7mp will give you 90X, at 5mp you get 108X and at 3mp is 135X.  This is Extended Optical Zoom.  If you need more zoom than that, under IResolution, use I-Zoom for an additional 2X at all picture sizes and digital will give another 2X, but image quality will suffer. I took some shots at the 10mp picture size with I-Zoom on, and the photos in my photo software are showing 3030mm zoom and they look amazingly good! I will post a link to some shots in the first comment on the review.,There are two FN buttons on the camera that can be set the way you want them to be.  I set FN 1 button to Bracketing and FN 2 button to Flash Control.  I may change them as time goes on, but I find it really great to be able to get Bracketing with the push of a button.,I don't care much for the lens cap, and ordered a better 55mm one on Amazon.,I use filters as it seems more often than not, I end up with my fingerprints on the lens filter.  It also keeps dirt and grime from getting to the lens.  It might offer some protection in an accident too. I would stay away from Hoya UV filters on this camera.  I was using one for a while and noticed the photos look fuzzy at full zoom.  I discovered it was the Hoya HMC filter I was using.  I now use a Sigma UV filter on the camera and it works great with no distortion at high zoom.,The camera does not come with a lens hood and none is available in the Accessories on the Panasonic web site either.  It seems there is no lens hood for this camera at this time.,This is it for now.  I will add to this review as time goes by, so check back often.,Addition:,I had a chance to check out the high speed picture mode with the camera and found this:  At 2 fps (frames per second) all works as advertised and it takes 2 fps for an extended period of time. 5 fps - it takes 5 frames per second for 3 shots and goes back to the 2 fps rate.  I tried it in Auto Focus mode and the regular mode with the same results.  9 fps - Once again, 3 shots and then the 2 fps rate.  H Mode - the camera took a very fast rate of speed (at least 9 frames per second) for 9 shots, or 1 second.  I have since found in the manual that at that speed the picture size is 2.5 or 3 mp.  I forgot which.  That is excellent.  The last mode is the Flash and it will take 5 quick photos with flash before stopping.  That could come in very handy at times.,I really like this camera.  I like the menu system on the Panasonic Cameras too.  I have the Canon SX50 as well, and still have problems with the menu settings and I have had that camera for 6 months.  The menu system just doesn't make sense to me on that camera.,I did a shootout with the Canon SX50, the Pany FZ200, the FZ70, and a Sony Nex 6.  The FZ70 images look about the same as the Canon SX50, and in my mind better than the Pany FZ200 camera.  The last shot is a Raw shot from the FZ70 camera converted to JPG.  The picture files can be seen in the Comments on page 12, the 7th post.,Added:  After using this camera for a while now,  I am even more impressed with it.  It takes great pictures and I really like the Panasonic Menu, which is laid out well and easy to use.  I am getting lots of keeper photos and the lack of noise in the shots is really appreciated!,Addition 10-29-13  I sent the first FZ70 back because the photos at high zoom were soft.  To make a long story short, it turned out that the Hoya UV filter I was using on the camera was responsible for the soft photos.  I have changed to a Sigma DG 55mm filter and the results are outstanding.  Sharp clear photos at all zoom levels.  This camera takes photos every bit as sharp and detailed as the Panasonic FZ150 or FZ200 camera and is as good as the Canon SX50 in sharpness as well.","September 4, 2013",5.0 out of 5 stars,Rolla Gravett

Almost all were in focus and image quality is very good for just over 100$. We also took the camera on a river trail mountain biking trip and got several complements on how beautiful our trip pictures were. Color of trees were a tiny bit faded but waterfalls and green/blue from river shots was true. Was all fine once I auto adjusted in software. It did fairly well with night photos in Paris. I like how compact it is and battery lasts a long time. Zoom also does not cause pixilation.

I dropped it off a second story roof onto the first story roof. It busted into several pieces. It then rolled down the roof and dropped 12' to the concrete driveway and busted into more pieces. I put them all back together except the two lens cover pieces. They're spring loaded and I can't figure out how they go back on. Even without those pieces the camera still works!

It was never able to connect to my Galaxy S7 or S8 or my girlfriends IPhone.  Spent hours w chat and on the phone - they told me to do all the obvious stuff that I tried numerous times - they were stumped.  After 2 hours of getting nowhere, I had to do other things - having accomplished nothing.  They emailed me, I replied, never heard from the again.  I REPEAT:  they emailed me, asking me questions:  I answered them:  NEVER HEARD FROM THEM AGAIN.  Not only that, but in my desperate attempt to get things to work, I signed up for the premium service.  Naively, I figured since it never connected in the first place, I simply deleted it from my phone not realizing I needed to go through the Play store.  You can imagine my dismay when I saw that they had been charging me for several months for a service they were entirely unable to provide - so far they got $550 from me and provided me with nothing, other than sucking my time and energy and failing to deliver on our once-in-a-lifetime trip to Hawaii.  I will never use GoPro again - at no point did these idiots think to apologize and replace the clearly non-functioning unit, they'd rather waste hours of my life telling me to do obvious things I'd already tried doing numerous times.  When you guys are baffled just as much as I am - its TIME TO STEP UP AND PROVIDE A SOLUTION.,I recommend checking out the Insta360 One or really anything else.  but obviously my experience is not the norm - if it was they'd be out of business.","July 9, 2019",1.0 out of 5 stars,Jing W.

B00HNJWUBI,Sony-DSCW830-Digital-Camera-2-7-Inch,Sony DSCW830 20.1 MP Digital Camera with 2.7-Inch LCD (Silver),"For the price I paid for a slightly used one, this is a steal. For its full new price, you can do better. The buttons are too small, and Sony should take a cue from Canon with the zoom controls. Having it on the back makes it impossible to do one handed easily. The pictures are decent, but nothing special. Same with the videos. The display needs a bit of work. It looks very washed out, but thankfully, the actual images/videos are not like that. I don't think people would be too upset with a purchase at full price, but they won't be ecstatic either. Shop around. If it goes on sale, pick it up. But if you can't get it for under $125, you should go somewhere else.","August 28, 2017",3.0 out of 5 stars,Tom H.
B00HNJWUBI,Sony-DSCW830-Digital-Camera-2-7-Inch,Sony DSCW830 20.1 MP Digital Camera with 2.7-Inch LCD (Silver),"When I first got this camera I was wondering if I made a mistake.  Yes I was looking for the impossible, an inexpensive digital camera with a fairly descent zoom and good features.  Can this camera take pictures in rapid succession?  No.  In continuous mode it will do 3 shots at 1 FPS.  Can you zoom in on the pictures and see good detail?  Yes and No.  Even set at 20meg the images sometimes do not bear close scrutiny if taken under low light, like indoors at night. But with enough light on the subject it takes excellent images. Did I experience a lag when taking pictures?  Well yes and no.  The camera takes a little getting used to.  While the closest focusing distance on full wide is 5 inches, once you start to use the zoom, that close focusing distance extends out to 5 feet.  So if what you want to take a picture of is within 5 feet, just keep the camera on wide and walk up to take the shot.  If you can't walk up to take the picture then use the zoom.  Until I figured this out I was very frustrated wondering why the camera would not lock focus on the subject.  So after all of these faults why have I given this camera 5 stars.  Well you get what you pay for.  I have a Sony DSLR and a Sony all in one.  Both cost about $1,000 at the time of purchase.  Those take fantastic pictures but you can't fit them in a shirt pocket.  It is unfair to compare a camera that costs a little over $100 to those.  But for what I intended, this little DSC-W830 is fantastic.  I get very descent shots which I view on my 27"" monitor.  It fits conveniently in a pocket and (once you understand the controls and get used to how it handles) takes pictures quickly and accurately enough for my needs.  If I need better I get out my more expensive cameras.  But for convenience and ease of use this little camera is a gem.","May 26, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,John

B00HNJWUBI,Sony-DSCW830-Digital-Camera-2-7-Inch,Sony DSCW830 20.1 MP Digital Camera with 2.7-Inch LCD (Silver),"Let me start off by saying that I have cerebral palsy which makes fine motor skill activities difficult. I am not the person that you want to call if you need a delicate touch for something because I am all ram and bam. I bring this up because this particular camera has smaller buttons to perform a lot of the cameras functions and with my rather ham fisted way of doing things I spent the first several times using the camera hitting the on/off switch rather than the button to take a picture.,I also had difficulty getting the battery and memory card into place because these actions require a very precise touch which I don’t have. I had to get help from my mom to make sure everything was in proper place. As people with disabilities have done with pretty much everything, I have adapted by changing finger positioning, so that I am not so close to two buttons. None of this is the fault of the camera of course, but thought it was worth a mention.,I will say the one camera thing that specifically bothers me is that it has a really quick trigger with my slower finger movements, I can probably end up taking 3-4 pics in a matter of seconds and that button seems pretty pressure sensitive. I can’t tell you how many interesting hockey pictures that’s lead to. It’s a solid camera, just a bit more of a challenge than I expected.","December 2, 2017",4.0 out of 5 stars,Michael Griswold
B00HNJWUBI,Sony-DSCW830-Digital-Camera-2-7-Inch,Sony DSCW830 20.1 MP Digital Camera with 2.7-Inch LCD (Silver),"I have purchased several Sony Cyber-shots over the years. I like that they take warmer quality photos, and are affordable. What I don't like so much with this model, is that the body is now plastic, where in the past it was metal. I fear dropping this one, as with an all plastic body it will be prone to cracking, etc.,There's an improvement in this model- with the fact that you can now charge your battery IN the camera. You just plug your camera into an outlet or computer to charge. In past models you always had to remove the battery and what would happen was the door latch would eventually break and you would have to tape it shut. I'm really pleased that I can now charge the battery in the camera so it will prevent wear and tear on the battery door.,The quality of photos and macros, etc is still really nice. You can set it to automatic or custom settings. I use my camera a lot on the macro setting because I am a beauty blogger and take photographs of nail polish color on my nails. Aside from the body being plastic on this model, everything else I'm happy with.","June 28, 2014",4.0 out of 5 stars,Sarah Lynn

I wiped the storage disk clean and reformatted it and I also reformatted the camera to factory settings. None of this helped.

For my wedding I did a scrapbook at the entrance instead of a signing book, So I had guest take a selfie( or had someone else take pic) and then they would write a message on white portion of pic. So with this size I was able to appreciate it better specially when it was a couple of guest versus just one person. Great Product.","June 6, 2019",5.0 out of 5 stars,Kenneth

No water got in on my test. A waterproof camera is a must for vacation, rain, or any water activity. I did not like that the battery compartment was a bit hard for me to open, had to buy a separate micro SD card, no carry strap, and most of all the microphone is not that great and no way to attach an external mike for videos.

Everything looks good except for the light kit connectors. they are very very thin and broke off both sets trying to set up the lights, the company was very helpful when I had a question about hook up. They emailed me very good pics of how to set them up. in the mean time I will use a 3s 1000mah lipo to run them mounted in back if the camera. will make my final review after the maiden flight......well the maiden flight went extremely well.

I should have known better. It DOES come with the 1 Canon kit lens. The other 2 lenses are XIT brand and the two of them together can be purchased for less than $20. They actually make the pictures worse. Also, just to note, these are not stand alone lenses. They screw onto the front of the lens like a filter would. These are completely not usable for any kind of quality pictures. An average point and shoot camera takes higher quality pictures than you will get through these lenses.,If this is your first DSLR, the kit provides a decent value. All of the components are cheap, but will give you an idea if those are things you will use and should replace with better versions.,The camera itself is (so far) awesome. The camera alone would have been a 5 star purchase. The package alone would be a 2 star purchase. The way it's listed and pictured is deceptive. Overall, it's worth the $10 over just the camera, but be sure to keep your expectations low.,All the included components are as follows:,$10.69 xit macro lens xt58wab,$8.93 xit telephoto lens xt2x58,$19.75 vivitar large gadget bag,$22.46 xit tripod xt60trb,$4.50 vivitar 4in pocket tripod,$9.16 transcend 16gb flash card,$16.99 transcend 32gb flash card,$8.68 xit remote shutter release,$4.93 xit SD/microSD card reader,$7.46 pro series digital filter set,$3.95 lens cap keeper (stick on),$2.94 xit universal screen protector,$3.99 xit digital ultraviolet filter,$3.00 vivitar cleaning kit and card wallet,$14.95 slave flash,Total accessories: $142.38,$449 Canon EOS Rebel T6 Digital SLR Camera Kit with EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS II Lens (Black)","November 18, 2017",3.0 out of 5 stars,Caete

I have been using it for about a month now, and it has been wonderful. It is a fantastic first time camera and does a great job at helping you learn it. The rating is due to what comes with the camera, so please beware.,Pros: The SD cards alone provide good value, as they can get expensive as you need bigger cards, for a first-timer, and as long as you aren't shooting raw+jpeg like I am, you won't need anything else. Also helps to mention you get a sd card wallet and a usb reader/writer. The uv and other filters are also nice if you want to use filters in your shots, when I first started out I was using a uv filter on my kit lens. I have since bought a much better lens, and do not use a filter anymore. The cleaning kit is very handy, I have no problems there but also bought a professional cleaning kit. The mini tripod is quite cute and has been handy a few times, beware, I have had trouble getting it to hold up my camera sturdy enough with anything other than the kit lens. As stated above, the camera and everything it comes with is good. It also comes with a remote shutter which is very nice as well. I tried it out with my silly little tripod and was pleased with the result.,Cons: My biggest issue with my purchase is it sounded like you are getting two extra lenses with the purchase. You're not. The picture you see of the three lenses grouped together: the bigger one is the kit lens and the two extras next to it are them. They are not lenses, they do not attach to the camera. I would call these ""lens extensions"", as they screw onto your kit lens like a uv filter does. They are also 100% worthless, please take it from someone who has already tried them, and then bought other lenses and compared the difference. I would upload the bad pictures they took, but have since deleted them out of my library. The bag it comes with is incredibly small, and barely fits all of your accessories, heaven forbid you go and get more equipment to add to it. I have since purchased a backpack that I can grow into, and the bag is now a spare parts bag. The bigger tripod is a cheap plastic, and while it is just fine for indoor photography and videos, I wouldn't dare use it on a windy day taking landscape shots. The flash could be a pro or con depending on your personal thoughts. It is not an ETTL, meaning that you have to manually adjust your settings to match the flash and how it fires, the camera will not do it for you. It also is completely stationary, it is brighter than the built-in flash, which is better for outdoor shots that you need to light up. I can imagine it would be difficult for a beginner, it was difficult for me.,Conclusion: If I had known better at the time, I would have either spent less money to get a kit without ""lenses"" or spent a little bit more to get real lenses included in the kit. The camera itself and the SD cards provide wonderful value, but I would not make this purchase again and wouldn't recommend it to anyone.","October 3, 2017",2.0 out of 5 stars,Stephen DiGiorgio

It's fully automatic but you can gradually take creative control of every aspect of your photography as you become more comfortable with the settings and features.  The tiny instruction manual included in the package gives just the basics and can be frustrating, but download the PDF file and there are your clear directions, step by step and in color.  For an experienced amateur photographer some of the items included in the kit will be redundant (who doesn't have at least two tripods?) but buying the camera, lenses, flash and cards separately would be more expensive than what you receive in this packed bundle.  The only thing I would change is one feature of its WiFi capabilities.  Unlike the Canon SX60HS, it can't wirelessly download to the hard drive of a computer.

B01MRCWQRM,Nikon-26518-COOLPIX-A10,Nikon COOLPIX A10,"This was a gift for a young family member. It is easy to use, and takes very good photos. My only minor complaint is that it's tricky to learn how to use only a slight pressure on the shutter button to depress it halfway in order to focus before depressing all the way to release the shutter. It's mostly a learning problem, but the key is for the user to wait for the on-screen focusing aid to change to green before depressing the shutter all the way down.","May 8, 2017",4.0 out of 5 stars,Rex Haskins

Do buy the cable; I had a very small USB cable for my old Canon camera but it would not fit the Nikon. It takes a while to get the hang of pushing the shutter release halfway, then pausing, then pressing it home. I think the people who complained of blurry pix were pressing the shutter all at once. One function I like is you can reduce a shot to an email-able size (640x480) in the camera. It makes a copy.,I selected this camera mainly because it takes AA batteries.

Let's face it, asking a child to stay still for more than a second does not work well. AND, action shots, forget it!!!  Even taking a picture of a child's triumphant moment, lost every time.  And, two pictures in a row, your kid will be done with that and moved on to something new by the time it is ready to take a second photo.

B01MRCWQRM,Nikon-26518-COOLPIX-A10,Nikon COOLPIX A10,Great camera. I have owned Nikon film cameras for years. There are no better cameras in the world despite what Canon owners profess !

The A10 is a more sophisticated camera with better features.,"June 14, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,Gary Blackshare
B01MRCWQRM,Nikon-26518-COOLPIX-A10,Nikon COOLPIX A10,"These are good quality cameras that last. I usually purchase the L32 for work but it is getting hard to find it available. The Coolpix L32 (,) has a 20.1 mega pixels sensor and this one has a 16.1 mega pixels sensor and that makes a bit of a difference in picture quality but if this is something you would notice, you would not be getting a camera of this type.,There are many cameras of this type that are either inexpensive and of bad quality or great quality but very expensive. This camera falls in a vanishing category of great quality at a reasonable price. This camera will take great quality pictures at 16.1 mega pixels and it is important to note that the zoom is optical which means that you will not give up any of the resolution when you zoom in. If your goal is to get the best quality you can get, and this camera does not make you happy, I do not think that the L32 would make you much happier so you will have to move to professional cameras that have detachable lenses and you are looking at many times the price.,There is something that you will not like about this camera and the only reason I gave it 4 stars. The world is moving fast to 4K video resolution but unfortunately this camera cannot even do 1080p recording. Considering that most cell phones today have 1080p video recording capabilities, you would think that a device that all it does is camera functions, would at least have the ability to record 1080p video. If you are looking for a quality camera that is easy to use and you want it to last, this camera is highly recommended. But be sure first that you just need a camera for pictures and not for video. This may be the reason why these cameras are at the brink of extinction, they are great picture cameras but our mobile devices have spoiled us so much that we do not want just a picture camera any longer. When we consider buying a camera, we do it because we want something better than what we already have in our pocket and that usually means that we are looking for optical zoom and quality lenses with quality video capabilities.,If you are still interested in this camera, here are some things that you may want to know:,1) It has an easy to view 2.7"" screen.,2) Operation is very simple and the menus are easy to figure out without having to read a manual.,3) It uses 2 AA batteries that you can buy everywhere. I had cameras with rechargeable batteries that go dead if I do not use the camera for a few months or their charger is proprietary and when it is broken or lost, it costs a lot to replace it. I love the simplicity of just putting 2 new commonly used batteries and be good to go.,4) It takes the full size SD memory card which means that you can just put in an adapter (many micro SD cards come with a free adapter) and turn it to a micro SD card while you will not have to throw away your old full size cards.,As for durability, we use cameras for the nursing staff to take pictures of patients and enter them to our electronic health record (EHR) software. We also use them for employee badges. Although we do not need high resolution pictures for these functions, when we get the less expensive cameras, they do not last for more than a few months. I always find them dead or the battery compartment door broken and held by rubber bands. So I have been replacing those $30.00 to $50.00 cameras with the Coolpix L32 and this A10 and I do not have any problems anymore.,Note that this camera does not come with a USB cable unless you purchase the bundle and it has a non standard connector. You can either use a USB card reader like this one ,, or you can buy the USB cable here, ,, which costs about 12 bucks at the time of this review.","July 8, 2018",4.0 out of 5 stars,John V.

I always liked them because of their ease of use and how well they worked, and the quality of the pictures.  All that is changed now.  The picture quality is terrible, many pictures are unstable, there are less features on this model than on the one from five years ago.  Nikon should look up some of their old designs and go back to them.  This camera is garbage.

So, now I get to track down another cable.  Then I found out that all the usb cables for Nikon are proprietary. You have to use their cable. Then I noticed there is no memory card included with the camera - this is my mistake not catching this before I ordered it. Then, in trying to call amazon to discuss... well, the Help button provides no HELP. It's an endless loop to keep you from actually reaching anyone. Shame on amazon.

Stabilization, Touch Enabled 3-Inch LCD, Wi-Fi, DC-FZ80K (Black)","I had a Panasonic FZ70 digital camera for at over 3 years now & it still works, but not as good as before & I pre-ordered this Panasonic [FZ80] a few months ago & recently received it. It takes the same battery as the FZ70 does. It has the same CMOS sensor & 60X optical zoom lens set up as the FZ70. It has 18.1 megapixels & a few minor internal tweaks, including some sort of update to their Venus processor compared to the prior FZ70 model; which is suppose to create slightly better images. Photo qualities so far with this camera seems pretty good & on par with the prior model, FZ70. Daytime outdoor photos are good, but in lower light conditions, the pictures are very grainy...as expected. Indoor photos with the flash are great. Video qualities seems pretty good with this camera also...indoors or out. This camera has full auto & manual controls, self timer, burst photo modes, uses SD/SDHC cards & comes with a battery, but no actual external charger. You have to charge this battery in the camera connected to an AC outlet. I would get an  external battery charger[s] & several extra batteries for this camera. Battery life seems a little worse than the prior FZ70....maybe 300 photos with no flash & about 100 photos using mostly flash...not very good, but not really too bad. The lens hood from the FZ70 fits this camera too. You do not get a lens hood with this camera. This camera  resembles the FZ70 with some minor exterior cosmetic changes, but both viewfinders are upgraded which are much better than the view finders on the FZ70.  Plus, the rear viewfinder is now a touch screen type, something the FZ70 lacked & that viewfinder is still built into the camera & cannot swivel or tilt. Wifi connection possible with this digital camera & the wifi options is in the camera's menu. This camera can take 4K videos & photos. You can also turn that feature off easily. As with the FZ70 camera, you can use an external flash on this camera too. Really, this camera's upgrade over the FZ70 mostly is 4K video/photo, using OLED viewfinders, touch screen rear OLED viewfinder, 2 more megapixels, wifi compatible, a bit more cleaner cosmetically speaking & slightly upgraded internal Venus processor. Menu layout on this camera is as easy to navigate...typical Panasonic easy to navigate menu system. Really a decent digital camera, but still can take a good photo or video. A modest upgrade from the older Panasonic FZ70 Lumix & can probably give the Nikon P-600 or Canon's SX-60-HS cameras both a run for their money now. I would rate it 4 out of 5 stars mostly because it's just a modest upgrade from the FZ70, lacked an external battery charger or lens hood and photo qualities are basically about the same [not a bad thing there].","April 2, 2017",4.0 out of 5 stars,Stormy1

Stabilization, Touch Enabled 3-Inch LCD, Wi-Fi, DC-FZ80K (Black)","The challenge for this camera like most bridge cameras with small sensors is image quality, especially  because of its phenomenal zoom range which can be increased even further with reduced pixelization. But, with this camera, contrary to the implied suggestion of most ""professional"" reviewers, there is much you can do to seriously increase image quality and have your camera pull well ahead of other super zooms, It is done both by camera settings and technique. Additionally, by processing, if you chose to go that far. You will need to work hard in order to achieve superior results full of color, sharpness, contrast and low noise, but it is doable even without RAW processing, notwithstanding the stunning wide to telephoto zoom range. To accomplish this, work carefully with the camera settings, pay close attention to get the optimal exposure, keep the ISO down, get the ""hang"" of the stabilization system, use spot focusing and area selection, and then use a tripod, monopod or brace like a shooter as I do. Finally, to do even more, shoot RAW and in processing go after sharpness and noise reduction, perhaps with an add-on noise reduction program like Topaz which plugs into Lightroom. The results from doing these things vs not and just snapping your shots are simply huge and stunning -- night vs. day. Just a word to the wise, if image quality is your real concern.,Update 9/15/14 to my last comment,For objects in shade/overcast, I use ""Vivid"" +1 contrast, +1 sharpness, 0 saturation, -2 noise reduction. For objects in bright sunlight or bright enough and nearer by, I use ""Natural"" -1 contrast, -1 sharpness, -1 saturation and -2 noise reduction. I switch between the two using the F2 button by having the Vivid settings stored as a custom setting and the Natural settings as the way the camera is set up. Pushing two buttons gets me back and forth quickly. Still playing with the settings, but these are pretty ballpark.","September 9, 2014",5.0 out of 5 stars,Kimball Corson

Also, when zooming in low light, the auto shutter speed is slow, causing blurring images. For example, in events with professional lighting, such as a big concert, I could take decent pictures of the lit stage from very far away. However, for indoor events with no professional lighting, such as school events, zooming from far away would likely have blurry pictures, unless I try to snap only when everyone is still.","July 13, 2017",3.0 out of 5 stars,TLe

It's got so many 'smart' options sometimes it tries to take the picture 'it' thinks is better and I have to hunt around to find a more manual mode to get it to take the picture I want it to.,It is a bit hard to take star-pictures because it keeps trying to either adjust my time to get more light or take pictures and average them.,But that's a limitation more of the slightly higher learning curve to really use this camera. The stability at full zoom is great, much better,than the Nikon, for example.,The lens is awesome, If you wide angle, be careful. It will fish-eye if you angle 'up or down' too much. Also,the other thing that is a limitation of most cameras that offer a '3d' feature is the 3d is not very useful because it only works,at 'max wide angle view', meaning distant scenery, which really never has much depth. 3d up close with the differences in depth,is what I wanted, but it disables the 3d if you zoom in at all or if what you're looking at is fairly close. So the twin-lens cell phone,that does 3d actually takes better 3d pictures for close up stuff.,Otherwise I love it. The ring mount is 55 mm so it's fairly easy to use existing lens adapters and filters or get a ring adapter for it.,The camera battery life is great and with an inexpensive 32 gb card it takes a lot of pictures and a lot of video. The sound recording,is also very good.","January 20, 2015",5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazon Customer

If it has a primary fault - it has too many features and learning to use them all will take some time. I shoot in Manual and Shutter priority mostly and some of the control could be smoother. Learning how to manually focus is cumbersome, hopefully I'll get smoother at it and upgrade the rating when I am convinced it does all.,The manual is a bit complicated.

Took a little bit to get used to the new AF macro, as I do a lot of shoots with macro.,Wasn't as precise as the older one when it came to the focus point.  Almost better to do MF macro sometimes.

B00I8BIBCW,Sony-DSCW800-Digital-Camera-Black,Sony DSCW800/B 20.1 MP Digital Camera (Black),"I have had 4 or 5 Sony digital cameras over the years and they have been great.  When I broke the screen on the last model (totally my fault) I was confident that Sony was the way to go.  A quick google search listed this model as the 2018 best point and shoot under $100 and I was sold.  However, I was deeply disappointed when it arrived.  Honestly I don’t care too much whether a camera has 8MP or 20MP (I rarely enlarge photos).  What I do care about is how long it takes to take the picture.  I hate trying to get a picture and by the time the camera focuses and shoots the subjects (usually kids or animals) have already lost patience.  This camera is way too slow; after every picture there was about a 3-4 second delay when the screen went blank.  Most pictures came out blurry.  Even changing modes didn’t help.  For those who care, this camera felt flimsy, my other Sony was lightweight but had a solid metal casing.  I might have got a lemon but I am guessing Sony got lazy with so few point and shoot cameras being used these days. So I am returning this camera, I haven’t decided on a replacement yet, but this is not worth $80.","May 15, 2018",2.0 out of 5 stars,Katie

I have to hold it very steady and even then the shutter speed seems too slow as I have a lot of blurred pics. There is  one small thing that there is really no need for and that the USB cable is not standard and I had to buy a spare just to connect to a PC or charge; so you have to use their cable and not the same one you would use for your phone or Echo, Etc. If I had to do it all over I would have selected another camera, and would recommend trying to get something better because blurred photos can be very disappointing.","January 2, 2018",3.0 out of 5 stars,AKM

B00I8BIBCW,Sony-DSCW800-Digital-Camera-Black,Sony DSCW800/B 20.1 MP Digital Camera (Black),"I am an amateur photographer and own three DSLR cameras with a selection of lenses. However that collection does not eliminate the need for a handy item for just daily needs. I keep this one especially in my car's glove box as a reserve for occasions which require something better than my cell phone camera. For that purpose it meets my expectations and even exceeds it. Yet, this is still a snap shot device with a relatively low price tag and therefore  a DSLR level quality (like background blurring, high shutter speed, high level of low light performance etc.)should not be expected.,Pros:,-Lightweight slim and  stylish design: It can fit in small spaces and look and feel like a high quality item.,-USB charging ability: That is one of the selling points for me. I keep it in my car and I don't want to run out of power any time or go through the hassle of removing the battery and charging it separately ,which requires carrying the charging adapter all the time and also the ability to plug in that adapter. Instead. all I do is to connect it to my 12V car USB charger and it pretty quickly accumulates good amount of charge level... It comes with a wall adapter (5V 0.5A) which connects to a detachable USB cable (so you can use the cable and attach it to any USB charger). But be careful about the USB cable. The standard USB-micro B cable that charges most mobile devices do not work for this type. If you need a replacement or an extra you need to buy a USB-UC E6 cable.,-Easy menu mode: Practicality should be the main focus in a snapshot device and even my grandfather could get through this menu. One of the most user-friendly interfaces I have seen so far.,-Panoramic shoot ability: That was a surprise for me. I had not read the product description in detail before buying and that was such a handy function. I used to take panoramic photos by taking tens of photos with my DSLR and stiching them with a software which was both difficult and time consuming. This function does it instantly and produces comparable quality photos.,-5X optical zoom: When it comes to zooming, in photographic terms, the less is often more. The best lenses even come with no zoom at all. However for a practical item like this, zoom is essential and 5X is a good range for the optical zoom (it is also critical that you compare the optical zoom capacities of devices and not the digital zoom before making a judgement.),-Image quality: As I said above, it does not match the quality of a DSLR and I don't care about the high pixel size either. For cameras with small sensor sizes like snapshots, it is actually better to get a low MP device for sharper images, but this one not bad at all especially in daylight. HD Video quality is also good but again depends on the light...,-Price: the $78 price tag as of august 2014 makes it one of the most affordable snapshot cameras in the market. You can get better deals from time to time but this is quite appealing too.,Cons:,-Low light performance: Again, I want to stress that I am not expecting professional quality from this device, but I found the low light performance moderate at best. The noise was somewhat irritating even with flash.,-Slow shutter speed: It has a continuous shooting mode which is supposed to take multiple frames in a short time as long as the shutter button is depressed. However this device has a long long refractory period between shoots that it is not even worth bothering with that mode. You need to decrease the image quality 3 steps to be able to notice some multiple shooting effect and that is not worth it. So if you wish to take a photo of a flying bird or a running person or a passing by car, you don't have much choice to take multiple photos and decide later.,-Zoom buttons: I like the zoom to be a ring style beneath the shutter button but this is like a plus and minus at the back which is not very convenient.,-No optical viewfinder: This is not a problem for this model only. Most recent cameras sacrifice from an optical viewfinder and all you get is a digital image on the screen to help you adjust your photo before taking it. First of all it does not give the sense of taking a photo but more importantly digital screen viewfinder drains battery and also performs bad in bright light.,-Video focusing sound: While recording video of a closely located object (where there is a constant need to re-adjust autofocusing) and if the surrounding is silent, you can hear the sound of focus adjustments in your recording. But as I said that is only obvious in full silence and for short distance recordings.,Overall you like it or not depends on your expectations. For me it is a handy and adequately performing device with quite useful features. I am happy with this purchase","August 28, 2014",5.0 out of 5 stars,Muttley

People setting their expectations too high are bound to be disappointed; to do so with this camera and expect it to be National Geographic quality shots are going to be disappointed. It's easy to forget that sometimes we have to start somewhere. That we weren't born natural artists or with a camera or paintbrush in hand. This is a fantastic little starter camera. Here's a couple things about cameras. Megapixels don't matter, zoom does. But when zoom doesn't pan out (rimshot), megapixels matter. So with a high megapixel camera with poor zoom comes along, megapixels matter big time. It allows you to edit and crop without sacrificing photo quality. ISO means how much light gets in the lens, illuminating your subject. Higher the ISO, the more light and less need for a flashlight, torch, lantern, match, etc. This camera takes AA batteries and a full-sized SD card. Pick up a 4-pack of rechargeables and a Class 10 SD card and you are set to go. Take lots and lots of pictures. Get used to the idea of ""no more film"". Go out there and make mistakes.

Just be sure to buy some rechargeable AA batteries to use with this camera (or find a very good deal on a bulk supply of alkaline cells). Otherwise, the optical quality of this camera is excellent for a point-and-shoot camera in its price range. Color rendition, optical (and digital) zoom, manual settings variety, and ease of use are all great. The battery issue is actually a plus for those searching for a good camera deal, as a small deficiency of that type will make the camera less popular with the typical user, and it will therefore be priced lower to sell off quickly.,You should be able to find a great discount on new or ""open box"" used cameras. Mine was purchased ""used, like new"" and it didn't have a scratch on it.,You will need to study and try out the various manual ""scene"" settings to get exactly the results you desire. If you make the proper setting selections, you'll create images of much higher quality than any phone camera.,So, three points :,1. Buy rechargeable AA batteries for this camera, or buy bulk generic alkaline packs. No Duracell etc. as they last somewhat longer, but are not justified by the much higher price.,2. Stay alert for discounted units.,3. Test out the many image options to acquaint yourself with the camera's capabilities for the best results.

It operated identically to the GE C1440 W, and i was very happy with the little thing. It takes really good pictures, and make sure to use the mode applications. They really help out. I was in Morocco on a fast bus, but I was still able to take crystal clear pictures without streak using the ""sport"" function on the camera. While this is clearly the same camera I had before, it still did everything I wanted it to do. Sometimes, the super-zoom function isn't the best (pix get a tad blurry), but, for the money, I can cope with that. Funny how GE and Kodak are somehow connected at the hip. This is/was my old camera.","March 13, 2017",4.0 out of 5 stars,LP

First off, I am an avid skier, and stable, well priced camera is very difficult to find, and usually is hard to use. This is not the same with the GoPro.,Firstly, the hyper smooth technology helps make every movement very fluid and smooth, making videos very clear to show to friends and family. Also, it is very strong. I have fallen many times while skiing the slopes, and the GoPro did not even get a scratch. Finally, uploading pictures and videos to your phone has never been easier with any other camera.,The GoPro Hero7 is also great for scuba diving. It takes high quality pictures and videos of the magnificent creatures that you may encounter while scuba diving. Also, the compact size of the camera really helps underwater because anything too bulky becomes unwieldy and awkward underwater.,All in all, the GoPro Hero7 is a great camera for beginners and pros alike.","July 24, 2019",5.0 out of 5 stars,Danny Lasa

B01CG62D00,Kodak-Friendly-FZ43-BK-Digital-Optical,"Kodak PIXPRO Friendly Zoom FZ43-BK 16MP Digital Camera with 4X Optical Zoom and 2.7"" LCD Screen (Black)","I just got a new Sandisk high speed SD card (which claims to be extra durable and fast--I can't say if it's durable, but it's definitely fast). For some reason this camera doesn't like it. It's 32GB, which I picked over a 64GB card specifically because some devices don't work with cards over 32. It works in my MP3 players and another camera.,The picture quality is pretty bad. My Moto E4 is 13 megapixels vs. the Kodak's 16, and yet the pictures from the Motorola (itself not even being an especially impressive camera) are about twice as clear. In pictures from the Motorola phone, I can read text on a pill bottle half the size as the smallest readable text in pictures from the Kodak. It's nice to have a real 4x optical zoom, but at the 2x zoom level the Kodak only looks on par with a cropped photo from the phone. Functionally, this camera really only has a 2x zoom benefit over a wide shot from my phone. I'd rather just take a wide shot and crop out the exact part I want later. I also have a Samsung SL30 which wasn't a whole lot more than this several years ago, and it is also better. Unfortunately, I think the Point & Shoot camera industry is mostly dead.,Focusing speed is not bad for a cheap camera, but processing and saving the image is slower than I expected.,Some people are complaining about batteries dying quickly. Possibly this camera is less efficient than it should be, but alkaline batteries are generally not great for cameras because the zoom/focus and image processing actually use a lot of power even if only for a second or two. Alkaline batteries are terrible for fast draining, even only in short bursts like that. I like AA cameras because you can always grab some AAs in an emergency, but for regular use you should use disposable lithiums or rechargeable NiMH.,Overall, there seems to be very little reason to have this camera. I wanted an acceptable quality camera to use separate from my phone, but this isn't it.","July 20, 2018",1.0 out of 5 stars,A Customer

B01CG62D00,Kodak-Friendly-FZ43-BK-Digital-Optical,"Kodak PIXPRO Friendly Zoom FZ43-BK 16MP Digital Camera with 4X Optical Zoom and 2.7"" LCD Screen (Black)","I bought this camera for a child about a year ago.  I wanted to take time to get to know it before submitting a review.  I was looking for an inexpensive camera that took decent pictures and was from a brand that is known for cameras or at least electronics.  There are few cameras that cost less than $100 from a reliable brand.  The only cameras geared toward kids are more like toys and are about 1 Mp so this was our best find.  The camera is compact, easy to use, and takes decent pictures, especially for the price.  The video is choppy and you can hear the auto focus constantly.  While i didn't buy the camera for its video capability that is one of the favorite features of the child, so it's important to know if you care about the video.,As other reviewers noted, the battery life is ridiculously short, even from taking it out of the box.  We quickly bought rechargeable batteries.  I would say that the battery life lasts 15-20 minutes, even with regular non-rechargeable batteries.  It's fine for playing around the house, but if we were out taking pictures on a vacation or a hike, it would be extremely frustrating.  Don't buy this camera if you intend to use it for any length of time to take pictures.  If you're looking for a first camera for a child (5-9) that will be okay using it for short time periods, it's okay.  I do agree with other reviews that leaving the batteries out in between uses also helps prolong the life of the batteries, which is ridiculous.  Too bad the battery life isn't better, I was hoping we'd be able to use this camera for a long time.","August 24, 2018",2.0 out of 5 stars,JG

Seems Sony does not want to fix it and accused me of abusing it so I will try,the extended warranty instead. While it is in for repairs I bought another. It is a good camera for around $100 even if it only lasts,about a year.

B00HNJWUBI,Sony-DSCW830-Digital-Camera-2-7-Inch,Sony DSCW830 20.1 MP Digital Camera with 2.7-Inch LCD (Silver),"Nice camera but has some serious problems. I compared the photos from this 20.1 MP camera to my Nikon S4000 12 MP camera. The DSCW830 (in landscape mode) has a problem with bright sun as it causes washout. That does not happen with my Nikon. We have gravel walkways and if the sun is shining the DSCW830 has a problem photographing the gravel, the Nikon does not. My 5 MP phone camera also does not. Other areas that are in the sun also get washed out. It appears that the brightness overloads the image sensor. I have been taking photos of our yard for years as we have lots of flowers and stuff that blooms from Spring to Fall. I compared a lot of previous photos taken with other cameras/phones and the comparison to the DSCW830 was disappointing. The color and clarity were not what I had hoped for.,However, if you are not doing outdoor photos then this might be a good camera as it is easy to use and easy to setup.","July 19, 2018",1.0 out of 5 stars,S.

B00HNJWUBI,Sony-DSCW830-Digital-Camera-2-7-Inch,Sony DSCW830 20.1 MP Digital Camera with 2.7-Inch LCD (Silver),"I honestly am considering returning this camera if I still can... I loved my Sony Cybershot cameras in the past which is why I purchased this and I assumed this one would yield *relatively decent* pictures. I wasn’t naively hoping for super crisp, professional shots considering the price, but I am very disappointed with the quality of the pictures this camera takes.... even with a flash, the pictures just aren’t any good. The speed of the shutter is super slow so if you’re trying to take even slightly low light photos without a flash, they will be, with no doubt, super blurry and grainy... and with a flash, the picture is washed out and everyone has red pupilsz The camera is lightweight, which is nice but I honestly don’t even bother bringing it with me places because the photos it takes aren’t worth the time or energy.... I was hoping for a light weight, quality point and shoot to use when I don’t want to carry around my SLR... and to replace using my iPhone all the time. No such luck with this lil guy, unfortunately... Perhaps I’ve lost my touch with using these little cameras, but I truly feel this products isn’t worth the money, especially for someone without any background in photography, which is who this ideally would be perfect for... in a perfect world.. anyway, don’t bother.

I even get comments like ""cool, someone with a real camera!"". This lousy replacement is so bad i ended up like everyone else using my iphone instead. Disappointed,.,Original review:,Purchased this to replace my Sony DSCWX9 which i loved until it is acting up after many years (plastic battery lock fails which i held up with a piece of tape) and it is not restarting properly upon pressing start button.,I want another Sony. I had had two previous DSC generations with Carl  ZEISS lens and i like to stick with it. After researching and reading the reviews, I thought Sony DSCW830 would be good replacement but NO.,1. Picture quality not good - the colors does not come close to the true colors that my old sony takes. The old sony takes sunsets for example, showing vibrancy in the hues,I take many photos for real estate properties and compare with my old sony, this one pales in comparison. it does not capture good ANGLES like the old one does. I took photos of the same rooms from same position, the DSCW830 cannot capture as much and as wide.,2. Smaller display LCD screen. I knew that before buying from the specs but usually when  they change a newer model, it is an upgrade. in this case, they reduce screen size for what? save cost of manufacture???,The only positive thing i like is that the video recording is quick and good.

YES, but it's MORE than just that.

NOPE! NOT WITH THIS CAMERA!...I was sent this yesterday, spent 30 minutes on the phone being apologized too. The Rep said he'd send out another camera, and I am too take out the AC Adapter from that camera, and return the rest...I said PLEASE MAKE SURE it has the AC ADAPTER, because if I get this again, and there's no AC adapterfor me to plug in, I'm gonna be really PO'd....After being put on hold, I'm told, YES IT DOES, and we'll overnight it for FREE!...OK, TY!!...Well it just came, and it's the same damn thing, NO AC ADAPTER to plug into the wall...Now, you CAN charge it via the USB using your PC & supplied USB Cable. Now for some, that is perfectly A-OK....But, for myself, and/or others who may not own a PC, or only have an older PC with a lot less USB Ports too access, it's not OK!...Now I won't do that ever again because in the past I did that with another small item that said I can charge it via my PC and supplied USB Cable and it F'd up my PC within a few minutes, so never again. I fought for months with those companies to get the money to fix my PC, and finally did!

I did that before I bought it, and I also read other customers questions and replies, and YES it comes with a charger and AC ADAPTER.....While I guess, technically true, if the camera's INSTRUCTION MANUAL SHOWS THE AC ADAPTER THAT PLUGS INTO THE WALL, THERE BETTER BE A DAMN AC ADAPTER THAT PLUGS INTO THE GODDARN WALL!","January 24, 2019",2.0 out of 5 stars,Ed Herrel

After learning from the manual, this compact HD digital camera turns out to be very functional, yet simple and lightweight enough for a kid to handle. The switch on the side of the camera controls close up shot vs landscape shot, while only in landscape shot mode, you can use the digital zoom option. As for the image sizes, there are over a dozen image / pixel sizes to choose from. Also there are various scene options for different scenarios on the go, all managed from the menu setting. It comes with a wrist strap, a camera pouch, wall charger with USB cable, and TWO rechargeable lithium batteries.

My favorite is the large tripod. The screen protectors do not look good on the screen so I didn't use them (see pic) The flash is by Vivitar so is the camera bag and table top tripod (which was not able to hold the camera) The extra lenses and lens filters provided are by a different company so you need to purchase an adapter to connect them if you want to use them with the camera. I took a few pictures of sunflowers on here to show you the amazing detail. Customer service is wonderful and super to deal with. The cleaning kit came with a soaked box and empty bottle but said they'd send me another one. So far so good, I think it's great!

I had one before the era of digital cameras and then I purchased my first digital version 12 years ago.  My 12 year old very outdated Canon Rebel was still taking good pictures but the lag time and some other issues had me looking to finally upgrade to a newer version.  After reading reviews, I decided to go with the T6 and the package deal offered here on Amazon.,This camera is everything I expected it to be.  An upgraded and better version of my older one.  All of my Canon lens and my Canon Flash attachment can be interchanged.  I still haven't had a chance to figure out how the Wi-Fi features works but will get to that feature shortly.,I am strictly a novice photographer. I really have no idea how to use any of the manual settings.  This camera helps a novice feel more like a, pro.  The quality of the pictures is impressive.  I highly recommend this camera for anyone that enjoys photography but may feel a bit intimidated by some of the more complex and expensive SLR cameras.  This camera is easy enough for anyone to figure out.,I also recommend this package.  Although I won't use everything that was included, the memory cards, the UV filters ,and the two screw on lens attachments make it worth purchasing the bundle.  As for the UV filter it's good to use just to protect your camera. Sometimes I remove it,before taking a picture and then screw it back on when I am finished. It's a great extra layer of protection.","July 25, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazon Customer

When the camera arrived last week, we charged the batteries, purchased a SanDisk SD card to store images on, and got a padded case to go with it. After batteries were charged we tested the camera and took several pictures to make sure the camera was working, and to make sure our daughter knew how to operate all the functions on it.  Nothing seemed amiss, our daughter was thrilled, and she was all set to go.,Upon her return this evening, we found out that the camera began glitching. The screen would freeze after taking pictures, every few photos. The second day she used the camera it froze and became unresponsive. Her teacher turned the camera off and on to see if it would unfreeze, and my daughter reported that half of her photos on the SD card had disappeared.  When my daughter took more pictures and tried to review them, there was an error message saying ""no such file exists"".  She then turned the camera off and back on again, and the device erased ALL the pictures on the SD card.,We have tried to connect the camera to our computer, and it will not allow itself to be recognized by our computer.  We hooked the SD card up to a separate card reader with USB port, and the SD card is functioning just fine.  Just empty.,This camera is a worthless piece of junk, and my child is now absolutely HEARTBROKEN because NONE of the pictures she took on trip were recorded, and she has NO pictures from her first trip to our nation's capital.  The reviews all said this camera was great for kids and as a starter camera.  I do agree with it's basic shape - the size of the camera body was just right for her, the functions were simple and easy to figure out, and the extra battery was a nice bonus.  But there must be some major flaw in the internal components for it to completely erase a brand new SD card.,Do not purchase this camera if you are wanting your child or family member to have a reliable device to take pictures of anything memorable. This camera should be taken off Amazon and any other selling marketplaces. It is a waste of money to purchase this, period.","June 3, 2019",1.0 out of 5 stars,A. Seaton

It'll still get broken, but at least it's not your phone and you're not out a ton of money. It is in fact the cheapest camera I could find where the image quality didn't make me want to yeet it into the sunset.,Overall, it's equivalent-to-or-better-than most smartphone cameras. It's got a decent optical zoom, so you can zoom in a bit without losing picture quality so it's actually better than a phone-camera in that sense. The zoom lens neatly retracts into the body when the camera is off so you can still stuff it into a convenient pocket (which is good because this listing doesn't come with a case). The sensor isn't anything to write home about, but it's the standard 1/2.3"" size for a decent compact camera (and the same or bigger than most smartphones) and gets the job done.,This has all the basic functionality I expect out of a camera - zoom, half-press the shutter button to check focus, a few different shooting modes that I will ignore in favor of ""auto"" 95% of the time, and a menu to review your taken photos.,Digging through the settings/menus seems a bit un-intuitive to me, but again I'm going to be running on auto 95% of the time so that impacts my experience very little.,It runs off (and came with) two AA batteries.

I am taking photos of still objects, not moving objects.,Many photos (with and without macro mode on) are blurry. I have always used Fuji Finepix camera and they took much better closeup photos, but none of their current cameras use AA batteries (only proprietary ones) and were the smaller form factor like this camera. I prefer using AA batteries so I can recharge/swab new batteries on the fly when I am in a dark attic or crawl space. Having to buy multiple proprietary batteries and already have an extra charged one is a pain. The manual for this camera is lacking and I think I've followed all recommendations for settings to minimize blur but to great so far..  what am I missing?

I know that reviwers here who buy expensive SLRs and (for some unkonwn reason) compare this camera to those and they are less than trilled. This is the camera for the rest of us who just want decent pictures and will probably never make large prints or posters from our pictures. I've used this for outdoor shots and very low light indoor shots of school cermonies. I'm all thumbs and know nothing about photography. My shots and videos at 40 to in the 50s zoom we crisp and sharp. I looked at the images on a 40 inch high def TV and it all looked amazing, like Blu-ray movies. I had no 'soft' images or video. I just held my breath and shot. The custom features take some getting used to and you have to really study the manual.

I still remember the fantastic OM-1 and my last OM-2. Since the introduction of digital cameras I have had some experiences with the small point and shoot cameras mainly from Panasonic. This were very good cameras but nothing like the professional Olympus system.,Based a lot on the reviews, I bought the DMC-FZ70 with a lot of expectations. Now I have to say that all of them were fulfilled with this amazing camera. With it, I can make anything I made before with my old 35mm Olympus and much more. The most impressive thing is the long focus 60x range . No need of interchangeable zoom lenses. With just one lense you can make all the range from a wide angle to large tele.,In addition it offers adjustments for deep of field, color temperature (with no need of filters), selective focus, image contrast, etc. There is a lot of technology behind this small and light camera that fits anywhere in your baggage.,The Lumix lense at f 2.8 is incredible luminous. With a firm hand (or a tripod) there is no need of flash during normal night conditions.,Other things from the digital era are new to me but I love them as the suggestions from the machine for beautiful sunsets, creative effects and much more.,The only thing I miss is the absence of leather case tailor made for this camera as I had for my old Olympus.,I am not a professional but I will recommend this camera for any amateur who wants a quality systems at much lower prices than most renowned ones.","September 7, 2014",5.0 out of 5 stars,A.

Stabilization, Touch Enabled 3-Inch LCD, Wi-Fi, DC-FZ80K (Black)","I will start this by saying that I am a big Panasonic fan and have owned several 12/16 mp P&S high zoom cameras (DMC-ZS20 for example).  I ordered this looking for a good super zoom unit.  I checked other reviews and noted the mixed ratings, but greedy for ""zoom"" ordered it anyway.,""Bad News"" is much like what others have reported in that you are paying for zoom and one of the ""give backs"" is in the processor.  In order to get really clear pictures I find that I need to use my monopod to steady the camera if using more than a modest amount of zoom.  It is early days and I am still learning to use the unit so I will update this as I go.  I also noted that Panasonic does not use a ""named"" lense on this unit like on my other cameras, which may also figure into things. I also am aware that talent may be an issue here too so I want to tread lightly here for the moment.,The ""Good News"" is that it's a Panasonic.  It feels good, albeit a little large and the price via Amazon was very good.  The camera feels solid and the controls are well laid out. The view finders do a good job and Ai mode normally does a very acceptable job.,I want to love this camera, but it is too early to tell if getting the zoom was worth it.,02/23/2014 Update:,I've had more experience with the FZ70 now and it really grows on you.  As recommended in other reviews, I've added a UV filter and a lens hood now that there is one for the camera.  Not being the best at camera manipulation, I found that working through the manual with the camera in hand is a big help.  I also found that using the flash indoors helped with photo sharpness.  I am also in process of working through and testing my camera setups to be sure, now that I am more familar with the beast, that I am achieving what I thought I wanted.  In the end there is just no substitute for using the camera in a range of situations as, while it is no DSLR, it is a whole lot more than a mere point and shoot camera.  I freely admit that most of my ""issues"" with the camera reside with me, and by working with the camera I am learning to appreciate all it has to offer.  At the price point that I bought the camera for, I am really glad I have it.,06/13/2014 Update:,I wanted to report that I went to Everglades National Park a few days ago and had a perfect opportunity to give the camera a good outdoor test.  While at the main visitor center I was able to get some great shots of gators at a distance.  The zoom was incredible as I was able to get some really close in shots of the gator's eyes and hide.  Really a wonderful experience.  It was a bright day so the UV filter helped especially when taking close in pictures of fish in shallow water.  The camera did very well.  Earlier I tried out my wife's Cannon D40 to get a feel for a big DSLR.  For me I have to say that I prefer the FZ70 as it's a bit smaller and a lot lighter.  On the downside at zoom the picture softens a little (lens quality?) but is still pretty darn good for anything the average picture taker would want to do.  The more I use this camera, the more I like it.  At a $1,000 less that the Cannon/lens, I'm feeling pretty smug.","January 11, 2014",4.0 out of 5 stars,R King

I can take ten pictures of the same item, just in different positions, and my brightness is sometimes glaring.

Since I'm a Luddite, still using a flip phone. As I had not bought a camera in about 10 years, my expectation was cheaper, faster, better.,Dunno what the heck happened in the digital camera industry over the last 10 years, but damn, nothing good.,Price - I figured to get something for about $50, since my last camera cost around $70. Nope; this one was close to $100. Some less expensive cameras out there, but the reviews scared me off.,MP - ok, this is a big change. This camera's got 20MP, up from I think 12. However, who needs that? Sucks up memory, and takes forever to load on Shutterfly. In fact, turns out my pictures were too big for Shutterfly and I had to squish them down. Yeah, that's not supposed to be necessary, but it's what worked for me.,Speed - reasonably fast turning on; about the same as my last camera. Not good - time to take a photo.,Two issues here. First, there's about a two-three second process from pressing the button until the picture pops up on the screen. After 3 months I still have not figured out when I can move the camera; not sure what the exposure process is. But I get blurry pictures a lot, so there appears to be some delay between pressing the button and being finished. Second issue - not gonna get many chances at a motion event, so time it well! 3 seconds minimum between pictures. F that noise.,Ease of recharge, battery life, pulling chip to unload pix - no issues. THat's all good.,All in all, this camera will drive me to get a smartphone. Or at least ask my wife to get me one for Christmas next year.

I always loved photography, and I have been using all kinds of different types of smartphone and tablets for taking pictures. While lots of those handheld mobile devices did very good at taking pictures, this SONY DSC-W800 beats all the smartphone and tablet cameras especially with the image processing like (exposure etc.) Also the 5x Optical Zoom is awesome lots of smartphone cameras don't have any Optical Zoom and the ones that do are very limited on the distance because of the focal length. Most new high end smartphone cameras have 1x-2x Optical Zoom which is barely noticeable. And digital zoom just sucks. So coming from tablets and smartphone cameras I have to say this is my best first digital camera I have ever had! The camera has auto focus, 5x Optical Zoom, has a proprietary USB cable for data transfer and changing.

B01CG62D00,Kodak-Friendly-FZ43-BK-Digital-Optical,"Kodak PIXPRO Friendly Zoom FZ43-BK 16MP Digital Camera with 4X Optical Zoom and 2.7"" LCD Screen (Black)","(See updates below this original review.),This is a great little instamatic type pocket camera as long as you use rechargeable batteries and don't mind charging them frequently. Of course it's nowhere near the quality of a DSL camera, but the price (especially when discounted) is a lot less as well. The camera didn't work in cold weather when all my other electronic devices work just fine. However, that was with the cheap batteries that came with the camera. The camera does go through good renewable batteries quite quickly, however--more quickly than my other cameras do.,Update after I've used the camera a while: I was having to recharge the almost-new, name brand rechargeable AA batteries in a high quality charger (i.e., I knew the batteries and charger were both good) after taking only around a dozen shots. So I called Kodak's support and was told rechargeable need to be at least 2300 mAh (milli-amps). So if you use rechargeables and find they drain too quickly with this camera, check the mAh reading. The support woman suggested trying new Energizer or Duracell non-rechargeable (i.e., throw-away) batteries to confirm the camera is fine and the low-mAh batteries are the issue. I asked why this is not mentioned in the documentation that comes with the camera and she said it's because they don't mention using rechargeable batteries.,Update 5/2019: I've had battery problems with the camera since it was new, buying and trying 2800 mAh batteries along with many others. It became clear the camera had electronic issues. I'd get battery exhausted warnings even with new batteries but by opening and shutting the battery compartment, the camera would work just fine. And occasionally I'd get a message to reformat the memory card though that also was fine and the error disappeared when I opened and shut the compartment. Kodak quickly agreed to replace it under warranty, however, they refuse to pay the return shipping (roughly $8, cheapest rate) which I feel they should pay.,My recommendation is if you buy this camera, test it out thoroughly when new, using either throwaway batteries or 2300 mAh or larger rechargeables to confirm the electronics aren't faulty.,Update 7.15.2019: The camera gets worse and worse. Kodak replaced my original one but I had to pay return shipping. The new camera has the exact same issues as the previous one. Furthermore, its recording of sound is erratic. I recently was at a music event where I recorded a number of short clips with the camera. A few of the clips have sound but the overwhelming majority have none. I just did a short test video and it has no sound. I have listened to the recording file with several different apps and on different devices to confirm the problem is the file itself--i.e., the camera--is at fault, not recording sound. So I am again lowering the number of stars I give this camera, now to the fewest possible.","February 26, 2019",1.0 out of 5 stars,B

The camera itself seems to be a good point and shoot especially for a teenage girl... if it would stay on for more than a minute.,The seller... I ordered this at the end of September for a Christmas gift. I was excited because I found this $60 camera for only $20 and thought I was getting a great deal. When I received it I turned it on and tested it out briefly. It seemed to work pretty well, however after my daughter received it for Christmas (three months later) and played with it for a few minutes it shut off randomly. At first it turned right back on then it stopped turning on and responding all together. We put different brand new batteries in it and once again it turned on but this time it shut off right away. We observed that it never showed a full battery icon even with new batteries. So obviously this camera does not work right and I immediately requested a refund. The seller, lotus media, refused because it had been more than 30 days since I purchased it. I wrote another email requesting that they take into consideration that it had been purchased as a Christmas gift and that was the reason for the delay, but they stuck by their “policy” and would not budge. I tried to file an A to Z claim with amazon and was told by them that I was outside my time frame for filing a claim. So basically I’m screwed. I’m glad that I only spent $20. Lesson learned - spend more time testing out electronics, a deal that’s “too good to be true” really is not a deal at all, and though I’ve always had good experiences with amazon I’m disappointed they didn’t back me on this. I can’t believe that this seller didn’t know exactly what they were selling and that’s why the price was so low. I’m sure they thought that was good enough compensation for the fact that the camera doesn’t work right, but this fact should have been made known in the description of the camera.","January 4, 2018",3.0 out of 5 stars,Laura Chandler

B00HNJWUBI,Sony-DSCW830-Digital-Camera-2-7-Inch,Sony DSCW830 20.1 MP Digital Camera with 2.7-Inch LCD (Silver),"I bought this camera to replace my old Sony Cybershot which had lasted 7 years.  I should have waited and saved for a better quality camera.  I use my camera to take product photos of the hand fabricated jewelry I design.  The shutter is a lengthy distance from where I hold the camera thus, I sometimes ""miss"" pushing it all the way down.  It's an awkward design for my hands.  Also, the camera shell is very plastic.  I know that this is the norm now but, my last 2 Sony Cybershot cameras didn't feel so cheap.,The resolution, on the highest setting available for this model, is sub-par.  Unlike the last two Sony Cybershot cameras I have had, this model doesn't handle low light well at all.,Having written this review, I must say that if one were going to use a camera for something like casual family captures, it's probably acceptable.

Nope, it is really a 5-sec delay between photos  I invested not only in this camera but and extra battery and battery charger.

Do a search on ""DocToPDF reviews,"" and you'll see what I mean. I can't imagine why Sony has not gone after this site to protect its customers and prevent infringement of its copyrights.,There is a workaround: Sony does permit a free download of a 2013 manual for an earlier version of the Cybershot that is close enough to the features of the current version to be usable, but Amazon won't allow me to include the link in my review.

It's only six months old, and the shutter button and the lens both wobble. (The lens wobble is noticeable when the camera is closed; it doesn't affect the quality of the photos.) It also occasionally struggles to find the right lighting when you're taking a picture soon after turning it on, providing wildly overexposed shots. And be warned that once it's claiming anything but a full battery (four bars out of four), it's going to start dropping fast.,It takes fine pictures and doesn't cost much, making it acceptable for occasional use, especially if you'd expect to need more zoom than you'd get from a cellphone camera.

This happened a lot. Once I turned on the flash but decided to not take the photo and I turned the camera off. Next day when I turned the camera on it would freeze and the screen would tell me to turn it off then back on. Did this several times. Tried turning off the flash and it finally worked again. Software issue? If I turned on the flash I used it and could then turn it off and on with no problem. Still under warranty but I'm going to dump it and try another brand.

It comes in 2 parts: the bottom, which stays attached to the camera via a tripod socket that screws into the camera's tripod socket; and the top, which is a ""hoodie"" that fits over the camera body and lens and attaches to the bottom part with three snaps. You're supposed to be able to let the top part dangle by one side snap while you take pictures, but mine was so heavy and the snap so loose that it consistently fell off. As another reviewer noted, the bottom part covers up the camera's side ports and door to the battery and memory card, requiring you to remove the whole case in order to access them. The faux leather is also thick and stiff. Although the case fit the camera well, I found it too unwieldy to be practical, despite its good looks.","November 27, 2013",1.0 out of 5 stars,Damon D.

The 60x zoom is just incredible.  In both sunny and overcast I get perfect pictures.  I've used it for friend's child who is in a university marching band, we sit about 20 rows up on the side of the end zone and I am able to get super sharp close-ups of anyone on the field.  I'm sure many parents know the feeling of when trying to take these kind of pictures with your phone and your loved one ends up a tiny ant in the picture.,I would not count on this camera as much indoors and definitely not in low light.  But for sunny and overcast outdoor, possibly well lit indoor arenas, it doesn't matter where you are sitting, the reach will give you great pics.,I was concerned initially as some reviewers would say things like ""better hope its not cloudy with a camera like that!"".  But I have several times gone full zoom in overcast skies and ISO doesn't budge above 80/100.  The stability and being seated or using a string tripod can boost even more.,Another advantage is that some venues, like college football do not allow ""professional cameras"" or cameras with lens over a certain length.  This cam is a pretty safe to get into a stadium as is clearly for amateurs and retracted, is quite unassuming.,If you accept it for what it is, it is a wonderful camera to make sure you always capture those moments and capture them up close and personal no matter you are seated.","October 12, 2018",5.0 out of 5 stars,Lee

Stabilization, Touch Enabled 3-Inch LCD, Wi-Fi, DC-FZ80K (Black)","The Intelligent Auto with this camera at the high and low end of zoom was far more adaptive than my Fujifilm S4000.  My Fujifilm camera (which is a 30x optical super zoom camera) had trouble focusing at times when taking indoor shots and some outdoor shots.  This camera had no focusing problems in Intelligent auto worthy of reporting.,I also found the white balance on this camera to be a step above my Fujifilm S4000.  It required me to use my flash more indoors so it could focus and that wasn't so much of an issue with the Panasonic LUMIX DMC-FZ70.  It took several indoor shots without the need for a flash and it had real time focus creating images that were sharp and clear.,On the long end of the optical zoom I did notice some noise in the image, but that's to be expected with a lens this powerful.  It performed very well in high range zoom and in both video and picture taking modes.  It's ability to focus in real time during video mode is pretty good and I tested it during a snow storm just to make it a little harder on the camera.,It's been boasted online that you can extend the zoom range on this camera by scaling down megapixel setting.  It does say that in the manual, but I haven't tested that feature.  What I do like about this camera however, is that on the low end of zoom at 20mm, it lets you take a wider shot than other cameras in it's class and some of them even cost more than this camera.,Would it be nice if it had a larger sensor?  Perhaps, but I haven't really seen any super zoom camera's that compete with it that have a larger sensor anyway.  That's probably more for an expensive DSLR anyway.  Besides, this camera takes pretty good pictures without the larger sensor.  Overall, I'm very satisfied with it and it's sure better than my old FUJI in every way.,I don't know if my opinion counts for anything but I can tell you this is a pretty nice camera.  I'm glad I bought it and I'm thoroughly happy with it and I bet there's a good chance you will be to.  For it's ability, features, and performance, I would say this camera is the best overall value of any camera in it's class being sold today, but that's just one mans opinion.,One thing I almost forgot to mention in closing, is that it has a 55mm thread at the end of the lens so you can attach filters for special effects.  That's awesome.  For example, if you wanted to add a Sepia filter you might be able to make your pictures look like they were taken way back in the late 1800's.  It's an awesome special effect.,Take care ... and I hope you buy this camera.","November 26, 2013",5.0 out of 5 stars,Todd M. Powley

Not near as nice as my old 600.00 sony camera but twenty megapixels and good for 70.00.  If your expecting aluminum body and a whole list of options this is not the camera for you, mostly an intuitive camera that doe's everything for you and shows you flashes on the screen of what it's doing, such as night time, portrait, facial focus, low light, etc.  Great kids camera but I think some adults might be let down if looking for a fancy sony high end product.

I found a manual in print on-line which I ordered (all 86 pages of it) and it will take up space and weight in my suitcase on vacation but it's at least something in words that I can use to learn to operate this camera.

This happened three times. It takes good pictures when you have fresh batteries, but as soon as you let it sit, it drains and becomes an expensive paperweight.

B00HNJWUBI,Sony-DSCW830-Digital-Camera-2-7-Inch,Sony DSCW830 20.1 MP Digital Camera with 2.7-Inch LCD (Silver),"The first camera received worked fine outdoors but i noticed it was hunting and having trouble focusing indoors even in a well lit room. If I hadn't had a lot of experience with this level camera from Canon & Lumix, I would have thought it was my fault. I returned it and the second one has no problems focusing indoors quickly. It's just as good as the competition. Things I prefer on this camera to our Canon A3500: 8x vs. 5x optical zoom but with comparable f-stop. Simpler, easier to use menu system and a standard usb cable for charging directly to the camera without removing the battery. The advantage of the Canon over the Sony is the lens retracts completely into the camera body flat whereas the Sony lens protrudes a little bit even when the lens is retracted and closed. Also, the Canon feels a little bit more sold than the Sony. Overall, the Sony is a great camera that takes sharp pictures indoors or out.

You have to put it into that mode.  It can do video, but I didn't get it for that.  Good Value.  Worth the money!  I do also wish, as constructive criticism, that there was an intermediate setting between VGA and 5 MP.  The pictures are either too small (150k) or too large (3 GB).

I have an older model of this camera which is much better and creates sharper more accurate images, albeit less pixels. The body and size on this overall feels a lot cheaper than the older model. The video isn't all that great either. I feel like some serious corners were cut with this and it was assumed no one would notice.

Great optical zoom, 20 mp resolution, which allows plenty of image to play around with software-wise. Light, easy to handle, intuitive.

This is my first “professional” camera that I have ever owned, but I think it’s safe to say I’m not so much of a “beginner.” I’ve done photography before but I’ve never had my own camera, so I thought this would be a good one to start with. I got it recently and I still have the option to return it and I’ve really been considering it. I personally like having a little more weight in my hands when it comes to my cameras, but that’s just a me thing. I think the camera settings are cool so to speak - they’re more filters to play with than be serious with, but that’s just my own opinion. The continuous shot feature on the camera has to be the one I really hate. It’s basically the same as the normal shot - it takes a really long time to buffer and honestly that takes away the whole point of a continuous shot. I also don’t like how I’ll see the shot I wanna take in the viewfinder, but the moment the picture is actually taken, it looks different. This is especially apparent when taking certain creative liberties with your lighting. Also, the camera does not work well with motion in my experience. Either it’s too late or too early, again this goes back to the continuous shot problem. Also I was told there is a photo editing program that comes with the camera, but I have yet to discover it. I do want to say this, if you have never done photography before then this is a great camera to get you started. I just have a bit more experience so it’s nkt really doing it for me. The zoom, though, is amazing. I was in my backyard and I zoomed into my neighbors tree that was on the other said of the neighborhood, and the camera captured the leaf perfectly. It was amazing. Who knows, I might give the camera another try, but I don’t know. This camera honestly isn’t bad and is worth the investment if you’re starting out or just like to take pictures. It gets the job done.","July 19, 2018",3.0 out of 5 stars,Cha Cha

This is my second Canon camera and I'm going to love the zoom when we are out nature riding and walking.  If I find I need a more advanced camera later, this will be the company for me.","March 6, 2018",5.0 out of 5 stars,FranT

The package includes an awful lot that I also wanted, most of all, the extra battery and charger, the case, and the 64GB SD card.  I realize all those things can also be purchased separately but it was just so convenient to have it all together in the box.  I haven't had time to take many pictures yet but plan to use this as my go-to camera when I'm out where I might be able to photograph wildlife, especially birds.  I have a smaller camera that fits in my pocket which I use while on kayaking trips.  This camera really doesn't fit in a pocket but it's extremely light and small for all that it does.  I look forward to putting it to the test in the next several months.","March 15, 2018",5.0 out of 5 stars,Janneke Bogyo

Man, was I disappointed!!! No matter which setting I chose I could not get a good picture in clear daylight. Instead of our family photos being a success they turned out to be an epic fail. On top of the failed family photoshoot, there is no way to format the pictures so I can view them on my computer. I have no way to edit or print them. This was just a disappointment all around.

It's a perfect fit, except the lens makes the camera too thick for comfort. So, XActo knife! I cut out a semi-circle for the lens--now it's ideal! The wrap-around flap still completely protects the camera, and the stick-out lens makes it easy to get the camera out when the flap is lifted.,I've tried a number of other cases, but this is the best. I like a belt case, and this has the loop. I wear it rearward of the right hip, and it sits in a spot where it's hard to see front on, yet easy to access. Sweet spot that does not interfere with sitting in a chair or car seat.,Only improvement, to my mind, would be a real snap instead of a magnetic one. The magnetic one is pretty good, but sometimes comes undone when putting on a seat belt, etc. Still, the flap keeps the camera securely in the case even when un-snapped.,Quality material & workmanship. I preferred a darker color, so wiped it down with black shoe dye, the rubbed with a cloth to get a darker brown antique-y look.","July 18, 2014",5.0 out of 5 stars,Big Max

Nice tanned leather; the strap matches the case (another reviewer said his didn't, but the set I got match perfectly).  A matching leather wrist strap is also included; it's a bit thicker than the nylon one that comes with the camera, and matches the case.  The case also has a leather-covered belt clip.

Love the width-wise case, the combination of soft suede interior and durable leather exterior, the slightly lowered sides that allow the wrist strap to hang out, and especially the magnetic closure. Only reason I didn't give five stars was that the magnet part of the closure pulled out of the bottom of the case. After putting it back in a few times by reinserting the tabs, it broke. A testament to the quality of the leather work is that the metal broke before the leather gave way.

It's pretty easy to use. It comes with a lot of stuff that I probably won't ever need, but they are nice to have anyway. I think it is a good value. The only thing that bothers me is that it depends so much on the battery being charged. There is no power cord to plug into a wall socket so that you can shoot table-top objects without the battery. You have to rely on the battery all the time. It can get tedious remembering ""Oh yeah, I need to charge the battery — AGAIN"". Down time. I was able to download photos into my Macintosh (which is 8 years old) without the battery being charged. That being said, you can't charge the battery while it's in the camera from the computer.

The one down side is that it doesn't offer an extended warranty, so I'll just have to keep my fingers crossed. The camera is great, the lens is ok. I have a better lens from my old camera, so I didn't use the stock lens much. As for the accessories- the memory card, external flash, usb reader, and remote all function with the camera.

I do senior pictures for fellow students and family portraits. The quality is amazing it’s easy enough to use point click and the flash works fantastic. The extra light I’ve set up as an exterior light for some photo projects and it’s worked fantastically. The tripod works in any ground pretty much with the help of a small level on the top of it. If I’m on a hill and I wanna know if it’s straight it works perfectly. The lenses are great! Perfect condition when the arrived, they are exactly what I wanted and what a steal! The UV lens is perfect for super gloomy days I think. It makes them look a little brighter in my opinion less bleh. Which is always nice. The bag it comes with is sturdy no tears no holes! The dividers are movable. You can take them out and switch them around! Which is nice since I’m always switching out the stuff I need for work! It has a million pockets to fit everything you need! The lenses have small pouches and covers to put on and in when you’re not using them. Handy indeed! The two SD cards work great! It has a little wallet like case for them that can attach to the cameras strap for easy convenient use! It does not has an extra battery for the camera however! It charges super fast in an hour and a half (1hr 30 mins) usually it’ll be fully charged! It’s also WiFi enabled! Meaning if you ya ether cannon app you can use your camera remotely through the app! You can also download pictures from it and tag locations you’ve shot at! Super handy!!!! The small clicker you can hook up on the side of camera is great! It works great! It’s very short however. Use only when working with nervous kids so they don’t see you take the picture! The pocket tripod isn’t that useful for me personally but maybe a smaller vlogger or general YouTuber could find it useful it’s only about 5 inches high but it’s super sturdy! The camera might look to big but it holds up great! I use the strap it’s semi comfortable it needs broken in but I don’t recommend it. It’s rough around the edges of it but still usable. I’m ordering a better strap because I use it often and my neck will hurt after shooting for 4-5 hours.,Overall great package!

This camera was the perfect fit for me. It's light and compact and not overly complicated. I came back with stunning images of leopards in trees, lions on rocks, etc. The zoom was definitely ""good enough"" to get some quality images that I will never forget.

Stabilization, Touch Enabled 3-Inch LCD, Wi-Fi, DC-FZ80K (Black)","This was my fourth Panasonic Lumix camera - I have stepped up from one of the first Bridge cameras that they offered, and I loved them. That is until, I got this one. My last camera is the DMC-FZ100. I wanted the upgraded zoom and megapixels. Let me say that the camera does have good points. The weight of the camera is a nice beefy feeling, and makes you aware that you have a camera in your hands. The zoom is INCREDIBLE! Wow,,,it almost breaks my heart to return it because the zoom is so amazing.,There is a hot shoe for an external flash. That is about where my ""WOW factor"".,Panasonic made a decision to leave items off of this camera items that had a GREAT purpose and now they are gone. Things like the tilt screen,,,the external MIC plug, the macro setting on the setting wheel is gone, and now must be found in the setting menu (it's easy to find, but it used to be easier to just turn the setting wheel). But the tilt screen gone? Why? Having a bridge camera is the reason why folks like me LOVE having a tilt screen. Most of us are amateur photographers, we LIKE the tilt screen! We don't want to manipulate the different lenses,,,many don't like having to mess with manual focus or settings to control many things. I for one like the ability to change my settings manually,,,but,,,I'm also only 5ft tall, I can't get many shots that taller folks can get. But, give me a tilt screen and I can hold the camera up in the air, tilt the screen down, and see what I want for a decent picture,,,that has been taken away.,That being said,,,I could live with it when I saw the zoom ability! I loved it!!! I could see birds hiding in trees from quite a distance! WOW - I was a happy shutter bug! Then I started to use the camera. The zoom focus was sluggish and super slow (it was not supposed to be this way). I played around with the settings, and was hoping that this would change, it didn't. But, I dealt with it, and started taking pictures,,,the back screen was almost invisible in bright sunlight, so I switched to the view finder. Getting my full view was a bit difficult for me, but I got the shots that I wanted. It was a clear, bright sunny day, not a cloud in the sky and spring cherry tree blooms were screaming for their picture to be taken. Out of 128 pictures taken from my walk, over half had to be deleted. This was an anomaly that had never taken place in my photoshop menu before. The ones that I did keep, all had to be manually adjusted for clarity. I was upset. I had such high expectations for this model camera. I was willing to give up certain items, in a swap for that awesome zoom capability, but the quality that was lacking in the photos themselves, was just not worth it. Many people have raved at this model, and the pictures that it takes. Perhaps I just got a bad camera? I don't know. I cannot be sure. And, I'm not willing to take that chance. I will be waiting for a different brand camera, to arrive on the market place in March. It will cost much more, but, at this point, I'd rather spend more money, and get everything that I want in a camera.","February 25, 2014",3.0 out of 5 stars,CMac -Amazon Addict!

BIG mistake. The battery has NEVER fully charged after the first time I charged it. The settings are so confusing I can't figure out how to get it to do what I want. The software that came with it has not worked correctly. With the old camera, I plugged it in, it asked what I wanted to do with the pictures, and it worked. After putting my old card into this camera and then putting it back in the old camera, the old camera software no longer worked right (and all of the instructions, for some reason, turned to German.) I kept trying to figure out the new camera and kept waiting for a techier person to help me out with it, but nobody seems to be able to figure it out. It takes great photos sometimes and horrible, blurry ones more often. The battery is dead more often than not and I have to use the old camera anyway. It is way too easy to turn on or off by mistake--although the button is in about the same place, it is easier to push it and I turn the camera off by mistake in the middle of taking a picture. I LOVED my old camera (and still use it even with the small problems.) This one was a waste of money. I wish I'd sent it back when I ordered it six or eight months ago instead of trying to figure it out.

B00PH2SDA0,MegaGear-Neoprene-Carabiner-PowerShot-COOLPIX,"MegaGear ''Ultra Light'' Neoprene Camera Case Bag with Carabiner for Canon PowerShot G7 X, Canon PowerShot G7 X Mark II, Nikon COOLPIX AW130, S9900, Olympus STYLUS XZ-2 Digital Camera (Blue)","I recently purchased a new Canon PowerShot G7 X to replace an older Canon for use when traveling. On a trip, I take a lot of pictures – both of scenery and of food – and I want a camera (and camera case) to be to small enough to wear comfortably (and unobtrusively) around my neck all the time. I was pleased with the size of the G7 X, but found it somewhat difficult to choose a case that I liked for the camera. After spending many hours reading reviews, I decided to order 6 different camera cases to see which suited me best. Note that ALL the cases I ordered claimed to be compatible with the G7 X. Surprisingly, the MegaGear “Ultra Lite” Neoprene camera case was the only one of the six cases to suit my needs – all the other ones were either way too large/bulky OR too small for the camera (I felt like the lens was in danger of being crushed when these cases were closed).,PROS for the MegaGear “Ultra Lite” Neoprene case: 1. the G7 X fit perfectly – secure, but not constrictively snug; 2. the case itself was actually smaller than any of the other cases that I ordered – all the other cases were larger (L x W), but some had a shallower or less forgiving depth; 3. the case was easy to open quickly to allow for fast shots of unexpected photo opportunities; 4. the supplied carabiner secured the case easily to my own neck lanyard (I like a longer lanyard length; 5. the case is lightweight and is a stylish and unobtrusive basic black (but, for those more daring than I, it also comes in hot pink, blue, gray and red).,CONS for the MegaGear “Ultra Lite” Neoprene camera case: none really, once you get used to the Velcro closure. I had originally looked for a case with a top zipper opening, but found the MegaGear’s top flap Vecro closure worked well and was really no more “noisy” than a zipper.,* I am pleased with my purchase and would recommend this case to other Canon PowerShot G7 X owners.","April 17, 2016",5.0 out of 5 stars,GSG

When it first arrived I was convinced that the camera would never fit inside it!  But its really stretchy and the camera along with a lens cap fits in perfectly, but tightly.  The belt loop and very secure and properly stitched and that combined with the tight fit means that you will not be able to get to the camera fast if its on your belt, so plan ahead.  Nonetheless, its a great sleek case, albeit with less protection.  And it squeezes down into a tiny size for storage.  The only thing I dont really like is the plastic clip, may have to break it off.,I also got the large amazon basics case for more protection, ie when tossing the camera into a backpack etc.","December 18, 2016",5.0 out of 5 stars,Pir

I agree with other reviewers who express concern about its ability to protect camera from a 3 foot drop. But if you want a case that will allow you to shove the G7x inside a bag or pock worry-free, it is perfect. All other cases were too bulky. It's also very compressible and so it's easy to quickly stow, leaving your hands free to shoot. I also like that I can keep the camera strap around my wrist while still having the case on the camera. That way you have the camera at the ready rather than trying to fish it out of a bag or disentangle it from a pocket. Can't comment on strength of belt loop as I don't carry it that way. My only real complaint is that it is VERY easy to deploy the lens accidentally while trying to squeeze the camera in. Unintentionally pushing  the side-mounted wifi button powers the camera ""on"" with the lens closed.  But once powered-up any shutter pressure (inevitable with this snug fitting case) will cause the lens to deploy.  Careful attention to where you press the camera will help, but I still have this problem. I'm thinking of trying the horizontal orientation instead.","December 28, 2016",4.0 out of 5 stars,Kindle Customer

Arrived quickly and fit the camera great! It was slightly snug but once I get used to using it, it was a snap to pull my camera out of it with ease. I loved having the ability to attach it to my belt. It’s more or less why I ordered it. I carry my camera on me a lot...like a lot a lot.,I used it for approximately one week which included some light hiking and a flight across the United States. Still completely pleased with it. However, once I arrived in one of my destinations I took the camera and case off my belt one evening and found that the stitching that held the belt loop nylon on was beginning to tear. :( I didn’t feel confident in it after (didn’t want my camera to come flying off my belt once the stitching completely failed) seeing that and was forced to spend more money on a generic commercial case somewhere which was big, bulky and in my opinion not as cool as this one.,Summary:,It was relatively cheap and a good deal at first. Being small, compact and flexible it was the perfect case for what I needed it for. I REALLY REALLY wanted to like this case and use it A LOT but unfortunately the stitching just kind of looked like a weak point in the product. Not really an issue of quality but more of design. If they somehow remedied this issue I would most definetly get another one which I would attach to my belt indefinetly.,4 out of 5 stars because I just liked it so much.

You can wrestle the G7X into the case, but it's tight, especially in the area of the lens/housing.  The Neoprene material and its stitching look fine, but I'm not sure it's worthy of protecting $700 camera from a drop onto a hard surface.  The limited stitching that secures the upper part of the belt loop may also be a weak point, unless your camera is very light in weight.  Removing and inserting a G7X isn't going to be a simple 'quick-draw' either, as the lens housing restricts the camera from being easily removed), so you're likely to miss a few photos.  All-in-all, the case is probably fine for protecting a lighter point-and-shoot from nicks and bruises while traveling around, but if you've got a better or more substantial camera you want to protect, I'd look for something else.  Not a big deal to me, but I did not get any lens cloth, as shown in the photo...","August 3, 2016",2.0 out of 5 stars,D. A. Waterbury

Photography is a hobby for me, but something I really enjoy and an area in which I want to continue growing. The zoom and clarity is incredible. I really enjoy having the extra battery and the charger that works in the car as well as the home. The disk reader is easy to use and caps so you don't accidentally lose your chip. The case is really nice with extra padding, space for the additional battery and cards, and a zip/velcro combo that makes me confident that the camera won't tumble out. I have not used the tripod yet, but it fits well. I had been researching cameras for months and this met and exceeded my expectations. I don't recommend for someone who wants the option of a flash since it only has auto or off. I don't use it for action shots, but it doesn't have additional modes like sport or portrait.

Most of my work is concerned with that, however this is the digital revolution and you need good equipment. iPhone's don't cut it. After going to several events where I needed good zoom and was getting pixelated garbage as results. This looked like a nice happy medium for me. Zoom is incredible, the WiFi option is awesome. I have to admit, I wish it would remember your phone with an automatic connection. You have to go into your wifi settings and connect it to the app to transfer photos, however after that initial connection, it works flawlessly to send photos/video from the Canon to your phone. Just wish it was a little quicker, absolutely not a hindrance to the operation  of this camera. It's also very easy to use, I'm sure some photogs out there would have their critiques, but I think is an absolutely great camera. Good for beginners and good for journalists as well.

The learning curve was short as I already own a Canon Elph and most of the commands and layout are the same. Curious however that a cable to transfer images from the camera to a computer is not included. I had to order one of those. But overall this is a fine little camera. The many additions included by this seller (spare battery, 32gig memory card, case, tripods, cleaning cloth, device to transfer memory card to computer and more) make this an exceptional value if you need those things.

You need like 3 extra batteries on hand if say going out for a day trip No other camera I have had (about 20 of them in my life) has died this fast. The pictures are rough. I would say 3 out of 5 are blurry. I have to take numerous photos to get any that aren't the least bit fuzzy. It might be closer to 4 out of 5. Sometimes it's minor and you don't notice w/o zooming in. I didn't realize that problem very fast because I use it more for YT videos than anything else. Also, the shutter speed for photos is rather slow, but it's a cheap camera, so that isn't too abnormal there.,The pros to this camera are that it is small, light-weight and films video in the 16:9 widescreen I need for my online videos. IF I could turn back time, I would have returned this camera and bought something a little bit pricier and better all around. Oh well. Hopefully, I get a better one from Santa Claus :)!!,I love this camera so far, as far as what I bought it for, my You Tube videos and other stuff. I only used it one full day, but the battery STINKS!! My other cameras last 5x's or more longer. Did I get a bum battery???? I charge it fully and take video and it starts going down to one bar and done FAR too fast to be normal. I read reviews that said it lasted people through many flash photos and videos during the day. I'm wondering if this is a camera I can take out for a day trip or not. My husband thinks maybe I got a bad battery. Anybody have any issues??? I love that it doesn't change the lighting to an orangey color, which is what the problem was with my more expensive, larger cameras. It's all over the place with those, which makes editing sooo difficult. This seems to stay true, and the video quality is very good. I wanted a 1080, but I cannot tell the difference to be honest. This is worth the $$ in the quality dept. & it is a Sony. I haven't taken photos yet. I'm just concerned about the battery. If the battery gets replaced and lasts a lot longer, than I will give this a better review. PS- The size is great, but very tiny compared to my old point and shoot. In a crazy house like mine it may not last the year lol. All is good but the battery. I'm thinking that may be a defect.","August 11, 2016",3.0 out of 5 stars,Twinpossible

It's almost impossible to get a great shot of the moon even under the best lighting conditions. Other than that the other gimmes were okay, but really aren't necessary. You'll find out once you start to actually use the kit. IMO look into getting a colored lens kit for around 10-20 bucks.

I'm frustrated the lens isn't usable right now, but all in all, if you have no supplies, I guess it's a start. I may have gone with another kit though if I knew the lens wasn't going to work.

I had a Panasonic Lumix previously, so this was supposed to be a slight upgrade over it (especially the zoom).  I would describe my photography style as ""lazy"".  It isn't that I couldn't fiddle with the settings, or that I don't at times, but I enjoy just setting it to Intelligent Auto and letting the camera do all the work.  The problem I've found is that at times this camera just takes blurry pictures due to it not switching to a good setting.  It also tends to take a lot of dark images.  At times you think you've taken a good shot and get it back on the computer and realize that it is in fact blurry.  Our previous camera's didn't have that problem except in some very particular situations.  Then again it can take some really nice shots too and the zoom is really incredible.

It was ground breaking at the time to have a camera of that size, that much zoom, and at that price point.  I feel the same way about this Lumix.  The 60x lens is an incredible amount of magnification that is usable, hand held, in good light, the image stabilization is that good.

When it came time to replace it, the Canon was being closed out and was a super deal.

Last week on Amazon it varied from $249.00-349.00, and that's on the one site! Needless to say, I waited until it was $249. I’m not a professional photographer so this isn’t a technical review, but I’ve been taking pictures for about 50 years, first with Kodak roll film box cameras, then a twin lens reflex, then a series of manual 35mm cameras (no light meter), and culminating in my ultimate 35mm, a Nikon FM. I’ve used various digital cameras that my wife owned, including a Minolta and a Canon ELPH. Until I bought my wife a Canon SX50 last xmas, I was not ready to give up my Nikon but the Canon astounded me with its picture quality, small size, light weight, and of course that 50X optical zoom (effectively 24-1200mm). After selling my Nikon, I was about set to buy another SX50 for myself when I saw the Panasonic FZ70. What attracted me was the 20mm wide angle and 60X optical zoom as well as the manual control options. I was turned off by some of the reviews regarding picture quality especially compared to the SX50 but after re-reading the reviews, I decided to take a chance and ordered it and I’m glad I did. I set it on a tripod and photographed a tree about a half mile away, first at wide angle then at 60X zoom and another at 50X zoom. And I did the same thing with her Canon. Despite tripod shake and a strong wind blowing the tree, the FZ70 took a remarkably clear shot at 60X. At 50X it actually appeared to have more detail than the Canon when viewed on my computer. I liked the colors with the Canon better but the colors are adjustable on the Panasonic so I could probably duplicate the results. I wish there was a way to upload the photos so I could show you.  Also, the 20mm on the Panasonic is a real advantage for me because I shoot mostly landscapes and the panoramic feature works as advertised, enabling you to take up to a 360 degree shot in one pass! Close-ups are also astounding, without even enabling a macro feature. As mentioned by another reviewer, the on/off switch does seem flimsy but at least you won’t turn it on or off accidentally. It’s also bigger and bulkier and hard to find a case for – I ended up ordering a Tamrac 5210 from Cameta Camera on Ebay which should fit. If you buy this camera and use a UV filter at all times as I do to protect the lens, follow one reviewer’s recommendation and get a quality multi-coated glass filter like the Sigma, because cheap filters can affect the clarity. I bought a set of Vivitar filters for my wife’s Canon from Digital Goya through Amazon and they seem fine but I opted for the more expensive Sigma for my Panasonic. To summarize, don’t believe everything you read. Different cameras perform differently under different conditions with different settings. Decide what’s important  to you and try several if you can. I’d be perfectly happy with another Canon SX50; it’s a great camera, but I’m glad I took a leap of faith and bought the Panasonic. No more film, no more lens changing, and I sold my Nikon and a Samsung camcorder which more than paid for the Panasonic – I’m a happy camper. If you’re a professional, neither will probably replace your SLR or DSLR or camcorder, but for the rest of us, these open a whole new world of photography.","December 28, 2013",5.0 out of 5 stars,Bill Benjamin

And if you like shooting birds and other outdoor distance things, you will love this camera.  Should be illegal with the zoom on this camera.  Stabilizer works great for optical distance, but IQ suffers when you extend the zoom.  And it really extends.  Try changing the size of the mps and it will go to super extreme tele distanc es.

One major pro is that you can charge it off of any USB port, and you don't need a separate clunky charging unit.

I read the instructions throughly and understood them, but I found the operation of the camera unnecessarily complicated and counterintuitive.  The scan disk was also difficult to remove: though it had a small spring mechanism, it didn’t boost the disk enough to get it out without tweezers.

There's an option to change the ISO from 80 to 1600 and 'EV' (whatever that is) from -2 to +2, but no way as far as I can tell to explicitly set exposure time.,I haven't had the battery drain problem that some other people mentioned.

The screen covers were of such awful quality that after barely putting one edge on my camera, I had a doubt, tried to take it off, and spent the next hour carefully scraping away the adhesive that cemented itself to the camera.,I dont feel comfortable even thinking about putting the extra battery that came with it in the charger, much less the camera considering how generic it looks. The same can be said of the little ""tripod"" stand with legs so short it can barely stand on its own as well as the ""stabilization brace"" which appears to be more awkward than useful.,In any case, the camera itself is an authentic Canon and of great quality, but the extras are things you're probably better off buying from other places to get real quality versus a low budget ""bundle"" where you end up paying for things you cant even really use.","August 3, 2018",3.0 out of 5 stars,The Fox

First thing I noticed is the camera is double boxed with a bubble mailer in between the two boxes to keep it from moving. Inside the box with the camera and accessories were plenty of packaging peanuts to protect the inner contents. The price point alone is worth the camera so the fact that they include all the accessories is enough to recommend this to anyone looking for a starter camera. I turned it on to make sure it was functioning fine and it was perfect and seemed easy to use. Accessories that are included are a travel charger, screen protector, travel case, extra battery, an SD card, wiping cloth, a care kit, a small tripod stand, and a usb SD card reader for easy access to plug into any computer/device that supports USB input. Honestly not only did they ensure that the product arrived as safe as possible but they ensured everything included was for every possible convenience. Hope my wife loves it!

It took great shots in the daytime and the zoom helped to get a more precise shot. I would not classify this camera as a professional grade to where you could head out and do wedding shots or photo shoots. In fact purchasing the $1000+ Iphone would probably give you just as clear and precise images for those of us who haven't upgraded yet as (July 8 2019). Camera came with a few accessories which was an added bonus including an extra battery & charger unit. Did not perform well under low light despite the onboard flash.

Stabilization, Touch Enabled 3-Inch LCD, Wi-Fi, DC-FZ80K (Black)","Great features of this camera: 1) the 60X zoom, of course; 2)  one can quickly switch between taking pictures and recording videos by pushing a button; 3) there is very little time between pushing the button and the picture being taken; 4) lots of fun picture effects and pre-set scenes - in fact, probably more than I will ever need; 5) the automated i-mode can produce good pictures in a wide range of settings, and allows for some customization of the shot if desired; 6) the macro feature can get you very close to the subject; 7) the camera can take pictures in RAW mode; 8) it can take panoramic pictures.,Not-so-great features: 1)The display is fixed instead of being able to swivel to different angles, which may make it hard to take pictures holding the camera above the head or of objects on the ground. 2) It takes a while to save the pictures, so if you are taking (with the zoom, of course) a series of pictures of your graduating kid you better stop before the kid gets too close to whomever is handing out the diplomas (thank goodness for school photographers). 3) Sometimes when there are strong variations in illumination in a picture the results can be quite bizarre, such as completely white faces on some people while others close to them look normal. I suspect that using the RAW format would prevent this, but I usually stay in the auto modes.,I am also wondering why all cameras I have used, this one included, seem to have the battery compartment next to the tripod attachment, so that if the battery runs out while the camera is mounted on a tripod one must remove the camera from the tripod to swap batteries.,My previous camera was a Sony Cybershot, which seemed to produce clearer, more detailed pictures. I don't know if this is due to the fact that the Cybershot had great quality optics or to the fact that I am still learning how to best use the LUMIX. I suspect that the LUMIX optics may not be the best, but they are certainly functional. So far, after a couple of months of ownership, I am quite excited about this camera - it is very versatile with a great selection of fun possibilities, such as the ""miniature"" mode. I have been able to take decent pictures of anything from the moon to bugs to family members. The zoom performs best with a tripod, like all zooms, especially when fully deployed, but the software does a good job compensating for instability when the camera is hand-held. There are better cameras on the market, but this one is a good value for the price, at least in my opinion.","May 15, 2015",4.0 out of 5 stars,Jane

I just wanted something that would take nice photographs from far away, action shots, and general photo taking.  This camera does all of that very easily.,I got tired of going to my kids' school functions with just a 4x zoom camera (or my cell phone) only to get THE WORST PICTURES POSSIBLE!  My oldest son had this graduation ceremony from fifth grade.  I was 200ft away.  They were too far away and the picutres I took closer were so blurry they were unusable.,With this camera, those days are over!  You can zoom in from so far away it's ridiculous!  The nice thing is that they don't seem to lose too much picture quality, either.  The picture quality is fantastic!  I will say this; if you zoom all the way out (or close to it) it gets a little shaky.  You can still take the shot but you might want to use a tripod or brace it on something.,Other than that, pictures come out vibrant and crystal clear, even with kids running at full steam.,I am very happy with this product.  I attached two photos.  The first one is pointed at the moon with no zoom.  The second one was at full zoom.  I had to use a tripod for the second one.","November 1, 2014",5.0 out of 5 stars,leo

I like the creative options on this one as well.  I took a handheld close up of the moon (slight shake so it wasn't a clear as if I'd used a tripod) with the super zoom on this camera and was able to see craters in pretty good detail...kids thought that was pretty cool!  My photos have been consistently bright, clear and focused and the video is great too.  I would highly recommend this camera to someone who needs a reliable, quality camera to take photos of their kids, vacation, everyday things...can't speak to the professional capabilities.  :)","January 10, 2015",5.0 out of 5 stars,SLP-mom

I knew that we wouldn't be able to get real close to the animals & some of the scenery. I had my professional photographer, (daughter), look at the reviews & specs. She said that it would be a good entry level camera. All I'm going to say is that she had my new camera in her hands 80% of the time. The words I heard the most was ""I hate this cheap, lite weight camera!!"" I think it had something to do with the cost of her cameras & lenses that was in her expensive case for most of the trip.,The biggest down fall that I read about this was the fuzzy pictures. I'm not sure why that happened because there was some amazing photos taken out the side widow at 80 MPH, even zoomed all the way out. Just remember to roll down the window, you get less reflections.,So my unprofessional oppion is buy this lite weight, cheap, entry level, camera if you need to get great long range & close pictures.,  Over 2,000 pictures, 1 drop of 4ft. on cement, battery held up great, just charge every night.

B00HNJWUBI,Sony-DSCW830-Digital-Camera-2-7-Inch,Sony DSCW830 20.1 MP Digital Camera with 2.7-Inch LCD (Silver),"At this price point, we can't expect miracles.  My other camera is a Sony a-6000, but the DSC-W830 was purchased as a simple-to-use camera for my wife--to replace her 2006 model Canon Elph SD600 (6 megapixels, 3x optical zoom, no image stabilization).  The image quality and noise levels are definitely much better than the old Elph with this Sony point-and-shoot.  But the remaining question is whether my wife should use this camera or her iPhone 6 while on vacation.,On paper, the DSC-W830 should be better: its sensor is 50% larger than the iPhone sensor, and it boasts 20 megapixels compared to the iPhone 6's 8 megapixels.  And the DSCW830 sports a Zeiss lens.  Using the intelligent auto setting, I shot several scenes using the DSC-W830 (lens at widest setting--25 mm focal length equivalent) and the iPhone 6 (29 mm focal length equivalent) and the standard photo app.  In the centers of the photos, the DSC-W830 images were clearly sharper reflecting the improved resolution of the sensor.  But at the edges of the photos, the iPhone 6 images were much sharper because of the large chromatic aberration for the Sony product.,I haven't tried out the P mode on the DSC-W830 in with various settings (exposure compensation, ISO, HDR changes, etc.), and I suspect that by fussing with the Sony camera I could make it perform close to the iPhone 6--in the center of the image with wide angle.  The chromatic aberration appears to be a lens issue, and I haven't tested different focal lengths (levels of zoom) to see whether it gets worse or better when focal length is increased.  The iPhone 6 probably has less of a problem with this because it uses a prime lens (no zoom).  Of course the DSC-W830 has the zoom capability (an advantage), which the iPhone lacks.,I tried out the panorama feature on the DSC-W830, and found the resolution of images to be so bad that the panoramas were useless.  The iPhone 6 panoramas are excellent--way, way better.  The SCN setting on the Sony camera may be useful, but the 4 picture effects are gimmicky in my opinion.  The screen menus are simple and easy to navigate.,Based on sensor size and number of pixels, I would have thought that the Sony camera might have been better than the iPhone 6, but overall it is equivalent in some circumstances and worse in others.  Did Sony use a cheap sensor and other inexpensive electronics? Is their firmware less sophisticated? I was disappointed in the lens performance (chromatic aberration, softness at the edges of the images).,I think that the Sony DSC-W830 is suitable for snapshots made by people who may be technically challenged--Aunt Ida or your 12 year-old pre-teen.  It is convenient if you are going to an amusement park with the family and just want some fun shots.  But if you don't need the zoom, you can probably get comparable to better results with your iPhone 6, particularly if you install the ProCamera 8 app, which makes the iPhone work more like a digital camera.,UPDATE,Previous shots were done in the evening, when conditions might have been less than optimal.  I tested the DSC-W830 in bright sunlight and with different zoom settings.  Results were disappointing.  The right edge of the image was blurred at 1X, 2X (equiv. to 50 mm), and 4X zoom.  I had thought that perhaps a smaller aperture (resulting from the bright sunlight) might help, or that the lens would have a ""sweet-spot"" at mid-zoom.  The blurring would be just detectable with a 4x6 print, but I wouldn't use images from this camera for any greater enlargement of the whole image.  You can have an acceptable enlargement if you crop off the edges leaving the center 50% of the image. One of the photos below (about 1/3 of the whole frame) shows the blurring on the right edge. I'm disappointed.","September 23, 2015",3.0 out of 5 stars,Ventura D

At least, not without a lot of pushing and undue stress on your lens.,HOWEVER, if you do as others have suggested, and cut out a semicircle for the inner front of the case to fit the lens.  Then it fits PERFECTLY.,I added some pics here to show a) the (poor) fit as it comes from the factory; and b) to show my steps to cut out the face and the results of the mod.,I found a pill container cap that just matched the diameter of the lens and used that - aligned with the lens & camera pushed down into the case - to mark the cutting line on masking tape.  Then I used a VERY sharp knife to cut through.  There are two layers of very dense cardboard in the walls that are very difficult to cut, so take it carefully (you DON'T want to slip!).  After cutting I wiped glue around the cut between the pleather and the cardboard to keep the cut edges together.  Then I used a brown sharpie to color the cut edges.  Voila!,You can see in the final pics, how far the lens protrudes from the case front with the mod.  Makes it obvious how tight it was before.","February 1, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,meq123

It takes excellent photographs, and the 60x optical zoom is amazing.  What is particularly surprising, and useful, is its ability to take great photos in dim light, without using the built-in flash; this was especially helpful in certain museum locations where flash was forbidden. It autofocuses very quickly as well. Sighting of the subject can be done by using the LCD screen (which is quite bright, even in bright sunlight) or, with the push of a button, through the small sighting slot just below the flash.  The flash, incidentally, must be manually raised and lowered for use, but this is quite easy and quickly done.","September 1, 2016",5.0 out of 5 stars,Robert Apfelzweig

Stabilization, Touch Enabled 3-Inch LCD, Wi-Fi, DC-FZ80K (Black)","I bought this camera for a recent trip across the southwest US. My first impression was that this camera is a bit bulkier than I expected. It is basically the same size as a DSLR, while many bridge cameras are smaller. The handgrip is good and it feels good and balanced when held.,The photo quality is just awesome. I am no professional by any means, but I do appreciate the quality of this camera and the photos it produces.,The things that I used quite a bit on the trip were the dedicated video button (you can start video recording at any time), photos during video (while recording, just snap pictures like normal) and the incredible zoom. While at the Grand Canyon especially, we used the zoom like a digital telescope to investigate things. I was sort of concerned that I wouldn't really use this camera's zooming capabilities, but I quickly found that I was capturing things and getting great crisp close ups of things that I would have passed on with my old digital camera; especially wildlife that we couldn't physically get close to. By the quality and clarity of the photos, you'd never know I was at least 50 to 100 yards away for many shots. The stabilization is outstanding, so at extreme zooms, you can count on crispness.,Another great thing that I noticed is how quickly the camera could get from a standing start - meaning turned off to on, then booted up, then zoomed, then focused, then capturing the photo. On our trip, many things would just happen quickly and getting the picture required a quick camera. My wife gave up trying to use her Samsung S3 to get any quick photos because I could grab the camera and complete a picture with the FZ70 in about 3 seconds, no kidding. It's like boom, it's on and ready.,I'm having some trouble forcing the flash on like the manual states. I have created my own program setting to accomplish this. I played with manual exposure settings to get some interesting effects. I tried to set it for extra long exposure times for star photos, but so far I can only get it to 60 seconds. There is a ton of options and settings, so I need to dig more.,Battery life is good and the camera feels rugged, yet not too heavy. I'm very pleased with this camera and it is a good buy for the money.","July 30, 2014",5.0 out of 5 stars,mohead

Oh, I could have spent twice the money on a ""better"" camera, but for my needs and the way I use a camera this one is just perfect. And, it seems - so far - the camera very well made. Note: I've owned Lumix cameras before so the learning curve (how to use the camera) is shorter. I'm very happy with my purchase...,A note on Amazons' packing... I was not at all happy with the packing. Amazon packed the FX70 in a box 3-times larger that the camera box and the amount of packaging material was next to nothing. So, the camera and the factory box rattled around inside the 'too large' Amazon box during,shipping. Luckily the factory box 'absorbed' any problems so the camera undamaged.","June 5, 2015",5.0 out of 5 stars,Diana Brown/Stephen Brown

I bought the DMC-FZ18 (8mp, 18X optical zoom) in 2007 and took some wonderful pictures with it. I love the EVF on both cameras., I made the mistake of putting a different brand on my wish list. Hubby surprised me on Christmas day with the other brand. I played with it but  realized it was so so good as the Panasonic brand. The other brand was returned and I ordered the FZ70 for next day delivery.,The other brand used 4 AA batteries that just didn't last.  Yes, there are rechargeable AA batteries I could purchase, but it's awkward carrying around multiple batteries like that. Two batteries had to be placed positive side up and two negative side up, but the diagram wasn't clearly marked under the battery door. The battery door felt flimsy and it was awkward to open. Lastly, I had trouble with the lens cap staying on the lens.,I like how Panasonic compartments have a way to keep the lithium ion rechargeable battery pack locked into position when the door opens. The charger and the battery pack are compact and not cumbersome to use.  There is only one way the battery can be inserted because of its shape., There are a lot more bells and whistles with the FZ70 but I don't plan to learn it all over night. I hope this digital camera lasts at least as long as the FZ18.","December 29, 2014",5.0 out of 5 stars,AZSnapSchotts

Looked around and researched similar cameras from Canon, Fuji, Sony, and Nikon, but decided on the Panasonic due to the wide angle feature.  I'm not a pro and probably will never use half of the features of this camera or even understand what they all mean.  I just want to put it in auto and go take pics.  Have already taken several hundred pics and I am very, very satisfied with this camera.  It takes awesome landscapes in low power/wide angle (my favorite pics to take) with awesome colors, crisp and sharp.  The zoom is phenominal and even with a tripod or monopod, you do lose some quality when zoomed all the way out, but still are good pics.  Although slightly larger than the other cameras, I like the size and ease of handling.  Really, the only negative I can think of is finding your way through the different menus and what all of the buttons and dials do... a little confusing, but I'm sure reading the electronic manual and using the camera over time will make it easier.  For the price, this camera is excellent and I recommend it, just don't expect it to be perfect in all areas and take pics like a high end camera. It's a point and shoot super-zoom that costs a couple hundred, to that end, it does an outstanding job IMO.","December 31, 2013",5.0 out of 5 stars,Rob7280

B00HNJWUBI,Sony-DSCW830-Digital-Camera-2-7-Inch,Sony DSCW830 20.1 MP Digital Camera with 2.7-Inch LCD (Silver),"This camera was purchased as an inexpensive alternative to a DSLR (ok - not alternative, but when traveling abroad, the teacher wouldn't allow my daughter to bring her DSLR so we got this instead).,This camera caused major distortion on the corners of images - so if any person happened to be in the corner - they looked pretty funny. This camera also had internal dust on the lens. I cleaned the lens several times - with the same stuff I clean my professional lenses with - and nothing got the dust out - so I have to assume it was on the inside of the lens. ALL images had this dust on them - and they are NOT easy to remove in post processing. I had high hopes for this camera being a nice alternative when my daughter can't take her bulky DSLR - but this is not the case. Not many of her photos turned out. Quite disappointing for a once in a lifetime trip.","April 17, 2015",1.0 out of 5 stars,K. Diaz
B00HNJWUBI,Sony-DSCW830-Digital-Camera-2-7-Inch,Sony DSCW830 20.1 MP Digital Camera with 2.7-Inch LCD (Silver),"I bought this camera to take on a trip to China. It was great most of the time. And the 20MP pictures are so much better than my phone. The slow reset to taking the next picture is a little annoying, and I killed the battery every day. I really wish I had gotten a spare battery. So if you will be out for more than 5 hours and you use the zoom a lot and take a lot of pictures, 400 was the most I was able to take in a day, you will really want a spare battery. The auto focus and image stabilization work great, so does the panorama feature. I dropped it a few times and it was still just fine, but maybe I was just lucky. Overall, I am glad I chose this camera, even with the short battery life.","December 7, 2018",4.0 out of 5 stars,Dan

While I've only had a couple of cheaper cameras that I could call my own, I have used a variety of cameras, but this is my first DSLR....and I LOVE IT! The Canon lens that comes with it is a handy for multiple situations and shooting conditions, as well as the ability to zoom a bit. However, my praises on this bundle, for the most part, start and end with the camera and the Canon lens. Most of the bundle is kind of a joke except for a few choice items, that I should say does still make it worth the additional $20 or so more it is than getting just the camera and lens without the accessories. The bag, SD cards, and SD card reader are all helpful, and are by themselves worth the extra $20 for the included accessory bundle. However, the stand alone flash is not compatible with this camera. The two ""lenses"" that are included are not really lenses at all, but actually screw on the end of your nice Canon lenses, making your pictures worse. The cheap filters are exactly that, a handful of cheap filters, that I suppose could come in handy, maybe, one day...possibly. I have not tried out the remote switch yet or the lens cleaning kit. And lastly, the tripod is a cheap plastic one that will likely get broken in a matter of a few shows during transport, and will likely need to be replaced. Attached some photos from the camera.,Tl;dr - This bundle is great, and this camera is amazing for someone who wants solid quality for a good price. The accessories that come with it are worth the extra $20.","January 9, 2018",5.0 out of 5 stars,Tyler L.

This was purchased for a friend and I showed him the settings etc. The simple auto setting only went up to a 5mp image which is likely why some people were getting poor shots.

The picture quality was not the best when seen it on the camera, but the image looks better when seen on the computer.,I gifted it to my dad who loves small cameras and is not concerned too much about the resolution of the image. I will possibly buy a new one that shoots a better quality of pictures even if it is a bigger size. The 20.1 MP really does not add much to the picture quality as expected.","August 18, 2014",3.0 out of 5 stars,Paolita

It weighs about as much as a pack of gum, yet it shoots 20mp, has an 8X optical zoom, a Zeiss Vario-Tessar lens and uses standard SDHC memory cards. In ""P"" mode you have full control over ISO, White Balance, Focus, Metering and more (though no manual mode). You never notice it in your pocket. $99 at Amazon. Amazing, and highly recommended!

B00HNJWUBI,Sony-DSCW830-Digital-Camera-2-7-Inch,Sony DSCW830 20.1 MP Digital Camera with 2.7-Inch LCD (Silver),"I am so sad about this camera. I've been brand loyal to Sony, since my first child was born, and we've used Sony Cybershot since 2006. When they broke in the past, it was my fault (dropping it etc), but this is my 4th time buying one, and the quality has taken a nosedive. It is not worth the name anymore, and now I don't trust the SONY name either.  This camera is flimsy, so the battery is hard to get in and out, but once it's in, it can easily fall out. But worse than the battery issue is the fact that it takes a long time to focus/take the shot, and then a really long time to take a repeated shot, even without the flash. You can't effectively take photos of children, which is mission critical for me.  The other Cybershots, even back in 2006 were not this slow!  How can it be this bad 8 or 9 years later?","March 22, 2015",1.0 out of 5 stars,A. Math Professor

I have an old Canon Powershot that has taken a beating and kept ticking, but the newer models don't seem to be as tough and aren't repairable at all. The firmware on this  camera is surprisingly decent. It has locked up on me once and simply removing the battery to reboot fixed that. The included spare battery is a very nice and useful surprise. Charging is fairly quick and when the camera is charged the red LED shuts off. Battery longevity is good to excellent. Setup is, luckily, pretty intuitive, because the manual is laughable and about as helpful as a plague-infected Deer Tick.,It's not obvious from either the camera or the manual, but there is a cool lens change switch feature  just above the USB port that allows you to shift the camera from distance focus to close and it works very well. The camera's software, however, far exceeds the camera's lens quality and that is the consistent limiting factor in picture quality. It would be unreasonable to expect a high quality lens in a $35 camera, so don't. However, because of the ease of use, battery life, well-designed features, size, and convenience, I find myself grabbing this camera instead of my Powershot 2 out of 3 times I decide to take a picture. If we lose it or break it, it won't be a big financial loss and I'd probably buy another.","July 22, 2019",4.0 out of 5 stars,GeezerCaveman

Cheap enough they could break it within a year and you won't even be mad (and definitely cheaper than letting them use your phone camera), simple enough that they won't be overwhelmed, but still handling mostly like a typical digital camera so if/when they step-up to something a bit more feature-heavy they're going to feel comfortable and familiar. The landscape/zoom quality is horrid, but the macro mode on close-up objects did ok. The menu navigation is simple and fairly intuitive.,The 21 megapixel claims are meaningless - the sensor is tiiiiiny so there's not enough data to meaningfully fill in all those pixels. Picture quality is actually more like 10mp in most lighting conditions, and even in bright light I'd only say 12mp equivalent on landscape shots.,There's no control (like half-pressing the shutter button) that will show where the picture focus is. The view display is grainy enough that it's hard to tell just by looking, and there doesn't seem to be a way to zoom in in""view taken pictures"" mode to check focus after the fact. So just, point, click, and hope for the best.,If you're an adult looking for a cheap pocket camera you're not going to cry about losing, I ended up getting the Coolpix A10 for about twice as much as this thing (and that's without ANY accessories), but the A10 has some optical zoom and a bigger sensor so average picture quality is better even though it has less nominal mp.","July 1, 2019",3.0 out of 5 stars,Amazon Customer

This camera is small and portable so I don't have to worry about it taking up a bunch of space. It doesn't come with a memory card, so be aware of that, but with the price difference between this and other small cameras, you can definitely afford to get a memory card. It comes with a wrist strap, carrying pouch, a charger, and two batteries. This is perfect for trips where you don't have enough space for a bigger camera!","April 22, 2019",5.0 out of 5 stars,Heath

Even at full 60X zoom [in sun], the photos were focused and the colors pretty accurate. Indoor photos with flash had to be white balanced but came out pretty good; though I liked the color balance better without flash. When I am watching these photos on my 27"" monitor they are pretty good; however, if I digitally zoom in 2 or 3 steps, the photos pixilate, show noise [especially when camera automatically switched to iso 400 or greater] or indicate they were not focused over the entire photo [espec. if depth of field was over 10-20 meters]. Check out sample of Panama Canal on a rainy/cloudy day, and statue in Guatamala on a sunny day with plants.,But for a camera with a 1/2.3"" sensor and such a great flexibility in lenses and shooting mode- I am very happy with the quality of photos and videos I got with this camera.

Stabilization, Touch Enabled 3-Inch LCD, Wi-Fi, DC-FZ80K (Black)","I bought this camera simply because of the awesome zoom range... I believe it's the only super zoom camera with the 20 to 1200mm range. At $227 price here on Amazon, it's just one heck of a deal if you ask me. Is the photo quality as good as  $3000 to 5000 dollar large sensor camera's with 2 or 3 different expensive zoom lenses that you'd have to have to get this same zoom range? No, but it's a few thousand dollars less expensive too!,Now, with that being said, I am actually pretty pleased with the image quality out of this camera and even find the low light abilities to be pretty good as well. I don't need to use the flash even inside with low lighting and the pictures come out pretty good. This camera has numerous different settings, more than I'll ever use. But I find the automatic settings work great for almost everything I want to do. I'm not a professional and not a photography nut either.... but I'd say this camera gives me as good of pictures as any I have ever owned... and given that's even when using the massive 60X zoom, I am VERY pleased with this camera.,The video recording works pretty good on this camera too. Now don't be fooled by Panasonic saying it will do 60fps, this just isn't true and is a mis-leading thing Panasonic puts out there. If you look at the specs where they say it can do 60fps, you'll see an asterisk that says the sensor output is at 30fps.... you know what that means? It means this camera will only give you 30fps output, not 60fps. They arrive at 60fps by duplicating frames. So you really aren't recording at 60fps. This is not an issue for me with most of my video recording and the video out of this camera actually looks very nice. But if I am recording something with lots of high speed motion, I would use my Sony Camcorder or GoPro so I have the actual 60 or 120 fps recording speeds.,In conclusion without getting into techy stuff, for this price range, and having the massive 60X zoom, I'd say this camera performs exceedingly well! I find the auto modes just simply produce great pictures very consistently, it just works! It also has many manual settings you can use as well, so I think it's a great all around camera. I think this is the camera I will use most often.,I've attached some pictures to show the quality in varying lighting conditions. I've ordered them in sequence so you can see the zoom progression from near to far. All these pics were taken in intelligent Auto mode, except for a couple that I shot in HDR.","September 12, 2015",5.0 out of 5 stars,Bob Eddelman

Stabilization, Touch Enabled 3-Inch LCD, Wi-Fi, DC-FZ80K (Black)","Wow what a camera!  I have had many, many cameras over the years from film to digital.  This is for me the best I have ever owned.  I love the way it takes pictures and all of the options available through its settings.  I bought this camera after doing lots of research and decided to pay a bit more so I could have both a wide angle and long lens in one camera.  I have a Canon with lots of lenses but truth be told I no longer want to be lugging around a heavy camera bag and tripod.  With the Lumix I can point and shoot or adjust speed and aperture to my hearts content.  My vacation has been greatly enhanced with this camera and the shots I have taken are vastly superior to anything I can take with my cell phone.  It has a number of creative settings which function like filters for close-ups, scenery or special effects.  It also does double duty as a 4k film camera for short takes.  I also like the Panorama setting that allows you to get a wide landscape shot to capture more of the surrounding environment.  One caution is to be very careful when ordering extra rechargeable batteries.  By mistake I bought a battery that fit perfectly but would not charge.  When I investigated further it turned out to be a battery for the FZ70.  So be extra careful and make sure the battery is for the FZ80.  Also, on that note the camera thus far has held up to a full day of photography.  I have had to recharge at the end of each day so having extra batteries on hand is a good idea.,This is a very nice piece of photographic equipment.  No complaints thus far and I can recommend it without hesitation.","July 26, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,Ferniez

Stabilization, Touch Enabled 3-Inch LCD, Wi-Fi, DC-FZ80K (Black)","This camera is a great step up from a simple point and shoot, while keeping all the usefulness of a point and shoot.  The zoom is incredible, and of course requires steady hands to get the best shot possible.  That said, the image stabilizer helps and you can actually take reasonably clear shots zoomed in by hand.  I was at a ball game the other night, and from my seat, the entire park fit in the frame of a single picture.  Zooming in, without digital zoom (60x), the batter would fill more than the screen and I was able to see footprints in the dirt...,I also took the camera to the races, and after a handful of attempts was able to get a classic picture with a clear car and blurry background.  That takes a little more skill to accurately track the car so it remains clear.  Easy to use, and the battery life actually lasted much, MUCH, longer than I was expecting.  Leaving the camera on, allowing it to sleep when it wants, I would be able to take fairly nonstop pictures all day I did buy 2 extra (generic) batteries as I plan to take this on a two week trip to Peru, but I am confident that it will have enough life.  The camera does have some weight to it but is easy to use.","May 11, 2014",5.0 out of 5 stars,Tim Beaudet

The choice is between being a BIRDER, that is, using binoculars to look at birds, and being a BIRD PHOTOGRAPHER, more interested in the great photo than spotting everything. Fortunately, I have had the good luck to travel with photographers, leaving me free to spend time looking. I've considered getting the gear necessary to take good photos, but the investment, both in dollars and weight, is significant.,Finally, a camera comes along made for people like me. It is small and light enough to carry around all day, yet capable of taking great photos. The lens extends to provide 60x optical zooming, coupled with superior image stabilizing firmware that I find myself snapping away. If the birds are distant, well, you at least have a record shot. However, when you have one reasonably close, you may get a real keeper.,I love this camera and it will be part of my birding equipment from now on.,The only minor complaint I have is that it doesn't seem to have an option to recharge the battery using the USB cable, meaning that you have to pack yet another battery charger on a long trip.","January 4, 2014",5.0 out of 5 stars,The Other J.

It looks and feels incredibly expensive... hard to believe a camera this nice is so affordable. It has a nice weight and is sturdy in your hands. The design makes it easy and comfortable to hold. It has a viewfinder as well as a digital display, making it versatile. Next, its functionality. The zoom capability is UNBELIEVABLE. I could zoom in to see freckles on my dad's face from across a parking lot, and I am not exaggerating. The picture quality is professional-level. I have yet to try the HD video feature but I look forward to it- I have no doubt it will be as exceptional as the rest of the features. Finally, the cost. This camera was not that much more expensive than most small point and shoot cameras, but the quality of both the camera itself and the pictures it takes is exponentially higher than its less expensive counterparts. I am truly shocked that an amateur like myself can afford to own such an excellent camera, and furthermore be capable of operating such a camera without any expertise.

I chose this camera because my first digital camera was a Sony and it took great photos (much better than the Canon I had replaced it with). Well... out of the three digital cameras I have owned this one definitely takes the lowest quality pictures. The pictures seem slightly out of focus, and the colors are bland and not at all vibrant. My iPhone takes much better pictures than this camera!","July 8, 2018",2.0 out of 5 stars,David Vinson
B00HNJWUBI,Sony-DSCW830-Digital-Camera-2-7-Inch,Sony DSCW830 20.1 MP Digital Camera with 2.7-Inch LCD (Silver),I bought this for a trip to Scotland. I was very disappointed with the quality of this camera. Landscape photos turned out blurry along the perimeter of the photo and semi clear towards the middle. We eventually gave up on this camera and just started using our phone to take pictures since the phone quality was better. The build quality of this camera also felt very cheap.,"June 3, 2018",2.0 out of 5 stars,Andrew S

In general it does what it was meant to do and should not be expected to take professional or near professional quality photos.

Not what I will be doing any time soon.  I went to Best Buy and a nice young man spelled it all out for me, taking time to show me exactly how to use all the features even though it was not purchased there.  I did buy the memory stick and a case from him because he was so helpful.

B019UDHT6U,Canon-PowerShot-Digital-Camera-Stabilization,Canon PowerShot ELPH 180 Digital Camera w/Image Stabilization and Smart AUTO Mode (Red),"UPDATE OCT 2016,Canon replaced the camera with a ""new or refurbished unit"" and this one has been working fine. I am grateful for Canon's warranty work but my sense is not to increase the review rating given that the issue seems quite widespread with this model. Those who are unlucky enough to have it strike after the warranty period are out of luck.,UPDATE SEP 2016,I'm sorry to say this camera has now started experiencing the dreaded focus problems that other reviewers have complained about. It still turns on and lets me select different modes, but will not take a focused picture. I got less than 6 months of use out of it - no drops, spills, or weather exposure. I'll try to get a warranty repair or exchange but I'm not optimistic.,As an aside, I have to say as a long-time Canon photography devotee that this is yet another Canon product that has not lived up to expectations. Other failures have included a Canon mid-level DSLR, 50 mm prime lens, and even a (very expensive) L lens which did give me years of service, but for that price should have given me years more.,***** ORIGINAL REVIEW *****,Long ago when I lived in Japan, I owned an earlier version of this camera when it was called IXY and it only had 4.0 megapixels. I loved it then and I love it now!,Full disclosure: I'm a photography nut and I usually take pictures with a full frame DSLR. In my experience there's simply no substitute for a quality full sized sensor and the lens to go with it.,But the philosophical side of photography tells us that the best picture is the one you get, not the one you missed because your equipment was too heavy or bulky to take with you. This little camera is a point-and-shoot dream. Out of the box, the thing just works. If you stand in the right place, point the camera in the right drection, and push the button at the right moment, you get a well exposed, color balanced, perfectly focused photography. From a camera that will fit in your front jeans pocket.,The battery lasts for a subjective forever - I've taken it on photo-heavy vacation and a single charge lasted most of the week. There are ample customizable modes if you want to tinker - from macro to exposure modes to filters and effects. To be honest, I never use them. The camera is good enough to get me what I need in its default mode. It has saved my bacon more than once when my primary DSLR was unavailable or impractical for the task at hand, and I needed something small and light that could still take a quality picture.,It's not the fanciest or most feature heavy camera you can find, but it's a great little workhorse that I wouldn't hesitate to recommend to anyone.","July 18, 2016",1.0 out of 5 stars,Tom

But the lens on this camera is very far back in the small hole, which you won't be able to get the finger to touch the camera lens.

There is nothing great about the camera it's small its light. The end picture quality is like an store security camera, any print you order all come out grainy no matter where we ordered from. Even on the computer the pic was odd quality. The battery life was good it was longer then expected. You still have to have a cd driver disk to transfer files to your computer so if like most  modern computers you dont have a cd reader you may have some issues. Without a sd card you can only take one pic. The navigation is not intuitive and the camera even lost 10 pictures for half a day before bring them back.

You just charge it with the power cord attached to it and it's ready to use. The 3-inch LCD screen is so big that you can see the image clearly before taking a picture, which I like very much.

However, the main issues I've had had to do with the CD (I don't know if my CD-ROM drive is going bad or what...), but in installing the drivers so I can upload photos from the camera to my computer, the CD never started or the screen for installation didn't come up. I had to go looking for the installation folder to get it to run. Once I got installed, I opened it so that I could download the few photos I took. Unfortunately, it showed a camera that I no longer have, and even clicking refresh in Photags didn't bring up the ABcam/Aberg Best. I was not able to locate the SD card on my computer to manually upload the photos. When I clicked on the link to go to the manufacturer's website, I got a warning from Microsoft Edge saying that my IP/server had notified someone that I was trying to do something regarding pornography! In order for me to continue using the computer, I had to call the Windows Online Help in order to resolve the issues. There is no way of contacting the manufacturer to obtain help immediately. I need to purchase an SD card reader in order to upload the photos.,If you're wanting a camera that you'll have to take to Walmart or one of the many pharmacies with a photo area in order to get hard copies, this camera is ok. The other thing I'd noted is that when I took pictures using the 21MP setting, they appear blurry and out of focus when viewing them on the LCD screen. At the lower MP settings, they appear to be perfect! I've used the 14, 16 and 18MP settings.

B00HNJWUBI,Sony-DSCW830-Digital-Camera-2-7-Inch,Sony DSCW830 20.1 MP Digital Camera with 2.7-Inch LCD (Silver),"I was needing a small camera for product photography. I have a dslr, but wanted something smaller and comparable to a smart phone when it comes to quality and portability. After much research, I settled on the Sony DSCW830. Partially because of the reviews & price, and partially because my current dslr is a older Sony model which has a similar menu. I've already taken a bunch of test shots with it, and so far I'm really digging it. Now, don't get me wrong, this wont replace your dslr camera. I wouldn't use this to take action shots. This would not be my ""go to"" camera on Christmas morning, as it takes entirely too long for it to snap the picture ... However, for my needs it's perfect. The macro setting is where this camera really shines, as it takes very crisp photos of small subjects. It also seems to perform well for taking shots where the subject can sit still and pose for you. The video quality is more than sufficient and seems just as good, if not better than most smart phones. The battery life is good for this size of camera, and it charges up pretty quickly. All in all, it's a good little budget friendly camera if you use it for the right things.,Pros-,Size,Value,Quality,Easy menu system,Good for shooting 'still' subjects,Cons-,Doesn't come with a case,Not good for taking action shots","November 12, 2017",4.0 out of 5 stars,hera94

B00I8BIBCW,Sony-DSCW800-Digital-Camera-Black,Sony DSCW800/B 20.1 MP Digital Camera (Black),"I bought this camera mainly for work purposes. I have a Cannon Rebel XS DSLR, and this camera in no way compares to the quality of it. Of course I wasn't expecting it to. For this review I will focus on indoor shots of about 25 feet or under. I will start by saying low light, and even no light, performance is excellent. I tested it in my completely dark bedroom and the picture turned out as if it were brightly lit. I will say now that the colors do trend on the warm side. Subject tracking is a nice feature, great for moving objects, such as pets, and for people who have had to much coffee. It has an ""Easy Mode"" which is great for good casual shots, but I think that it's a little TO simple. It simplifies the menu choices to one: large images or small images. I personally think they should had left all of the sizes selectable in this mode. Video is limited to 1280x720, but this is more than enough for close up movies. The rated battery life is fairly short at 100 minutes, but this is most likely due to the viewscreen. Additional batteries are, as of this review, under $13 for the Sony battery NP-BN1, and half that for generics, which is very inexpensive for a camera battery. It charges via a special USB cable, which I hate, instead of a standard USB Type B which all small electrical devices seem to charge from, so be careful that you don't damage it. The included AC Adapter connects through the USB cable as well, and outputs 0.5A, so it is no faster than charging it from any other USB source.,All in all I would say this is a great camera for taking pictures up close, under 20 feet ideally. It's compact size, portability, features, and low cost make it a great camera for close up shots. It's not close to a DSLR quality, and I wouldn't think about using it to record once in a lifetime memories, but it's also less than 10% of the cost of a DSLR, and a great item to have around.","March 29, 2015",4.0 out of 5 stars,Matt

The viewfinder is bright enough but is of poor quality and considering this has such as large zoom range, having a good EVF is very important. There is the ability to change the brightness of the LCD screen and many users are not aware there is a framing grid overlay grid you can find in the settings so you have a visual horizontal and vertical grid to assist in composition of your shots. ..useful for keeping sunset horizons straight for example.,The camera is speedy in it's startup and focusing time.  The zoom is smooth and increases in just the right increments.  There is no focus assist magnification,  a feature that magnifies a small portion of the focus point to help you visualize detail of that area which is useful when using a long zoom and would've been a very useful tool for a zoom of this magnitude.,Shame I have to return this camera, it felt good in my hands as far as the body grip and I wanted to make it work.","October 23, 2016",2.0 out of 5 stars,electrlux

I wanted a camera that would fulfill my desire for great pictures, up close and in the distance, at a reasonable price.  My ZS20 fills my everyday need but this FZ70 does so much more but is too big to carry in my purse.  Of course, there is a lot more to learn about this camera but then it does a lot more than my other cameras.  It is light weight enough to handle with ease and I like the feel of it in my hands.

What I didn't like and why I don't recommend this camera to anyone I know is that the DISPLAY is of the lowest quality possible, VERY DARK and almost monocrome.

When I transferred the pictures and videos to my computer to see the quality of it, it's still very pixelated even as I compare all the different quality settings. The camera is exactly like the picture and the screen flips perfectly fine. But not the quality that was being described in the description.

I've been a longtime fan of canon rebel SLR. I was worried the digital model wouldn't live up to its predecessor. My worries were unfounded. Everything about this camera is wonderful. Easy to figure out (even for an old lady like me). I recommend spending several days with the camera just trying out all the features and functions before using it for an important event, because there are so many enhancements and possibilities. You COULD just put it on auto and get fantastic pictures, but then what would be the point of buying a camera with so many great features? The lenses included in this bundle are all great. The 500mm, I didn't think I'd use, but it's been so fun taking pics of the moon. It takes time to get used to the light balance if you are used to film cameras, so practice with it if that's how you started. If you started on digital cameras, you won't have any problems. The camera bag is too small to hold everything that comes with it, so if you want to take everything with you, get a bigger bag. The bag isn't waterproof, either. Just water resistant. So a good, large, waterproof camera bag is a good additional purchase. You can't go wrong with this bundle. I was so nervous buying something this expensive online, but I'm so happy I bought it.Included a few photos I've taken with it since buying it in June. The moon is with 500mm lens, manual setting w/250 shutter speed (on tripod using the included shutter cord/button). The other pics are in Colorado.","July 23, 2018",5.0 out of 5 stars,Elizabeth Bonecher-Brenaman

I've been shopping around for this type of camera and lenses for quite some time so I knew what I wanted and the average price. Let me say, it was way more than this.

I've used a camera like this with my work so I am familiar with it and this one met all my expectations. I have not tried the very large lens yet but the two Cannon lenses work great. I also have not tried the flash that came with it yet. I'm delighted to have a mono-pole but will use a regular tripod, which I already have, when using the longest lens. I do have to say the bag that came with this stuff is a bit cheap feeling. I quickly ditched that and got a backpack to transport everything.","June 7, 2018",5.0 out of 5 stars,michs

Loved that camera!!! Then I bought an SX40 and loved that camera and last year decided on something stronger - the SX60. For some reason I couldn't get a feeling for that one. Then I saw the T6 w/the 500mm lens.  Almost identical to the XTi - only digital. Bought it on Black Friday, had it Saturday. I couldn't have asked for better packaging with the camera and one lens wrapped with bubble wrap. The 75-300 was in a box of it own and packed so it wouldn't bounce around. The whole bundle was packed very securely. Tried the camera and lenses and all worked as it should. I can see an affair coming already with this camera.

The pictures are crisp and clear. I only have enlarged one (8x10) that I did use the zoom feature on and it came out lovely.,I guess it is a personal preference but I love the feel of the camera in my hands and the quality of the photos.

I have to admit this is the first really nice camera that I have purchased in several years but it has exceeded my expectations.  The zoom on this camera is impressive.  I was looking for a camera that would take great photos and video, it has exceeded my expectations for both of these requirements.  I was really suprised by the clarity even when using the extended digital zoom.  In the past when I have used the digital zoom on other cameras the picture quality was horrible.  The digital zoom on this camera produces pretty good photos.  I have been playing around with several of the features on this camera but still have a lot to learn.  I think this camera's options will satisfy most users.  If you just want to point and shoot you can always use the automatic settings which produce fantastic pictures.  For the price and quality, this camera is hard to beat.  So far the battery life is great, I have taken several hundred photos (mostly w/o flash) and taken probably an hours worth of video, the battery is still about 1/4-1/2 full.

This is a bridge camera and not a dslr so with that in mind, this camera for the money is the best you can do.  I have had lots of bridge cameras from all makes (even the Canon SX50 which is a very good camera, but with crazy set up controls and too small), but this one beats them all taking the cost into account.  The zoom is phenomenal especially if you set the camera to 7MP and put it on a tripod.  This zoom should be illegal!!  Or you can shoot at the 16MP and go to 60x and get a great shot.  Sure it has some weak points like no tilting LCD, but every camera has its weak points. IQ clarity is a strength for this camera.  With the price it is selling for on Amazon, I should buy another one.","March 20, 2014",5.0 out of 5 stars,Ben Johnson

It takes remarkably good pictures in very low light situations, too.,For the last several months though, I have been struggling with a rear dial which has stretches where it ignores rotation (or worse, responds as if I were rotating it in the opposite direction).  As the camera is virtually useless without a functioning rear dial, I was rather disturbed.,Then I remembered I had recently had problems with my computer's mouse. After an internet search, I found that breathing on the mouse button area - getting some humid air inside the mouse - fixed the problem for me.,Having nothing to lose, I tried the same thing this morning with my camera, putting my mouth over the rear dial and exhaling several times to force humid air inside the camera.

I was very pleased with how easy it was to use this camera and loved the pictures it took.  I do have some trouble using the telescope lens, and they do offer other packages so if that's something you don't need, you may want to chose a package with a different lens.  I use this camera all the time living in the woods for wildlife pictures and they are professional quality.  It did come with a lot of extras and I haven't used some of them.  However, I shopped around for this specific camera and this price couldn't be beat.  I even went to a store to look at this exact camera before purchasing and the store's price just for the camera and a small lens was more than this whole package.  Definitely very pleased with this purchase.","January 13, 2019",5.0 out of 5 stars,Mary

It has settings for different types of picture types. My camera is generally set on sports mode, but I have taken portrait photos and landscape photos. The bundle comes with light filters and screens, which allow you to control the amount of light coming into the lens. This is awesome for Friday Night Lights photos. I also love the two different lenses that come in the bundle. They make taking photos super easy based on your distance from the subject and how up close and personal you want to be. If you are a manual reader as I am, you can make your photos even crisper by adjusting the shutter speed. This is accomplished by knowing which small dial to turn. The autofocus feature is also nice.

I feel like you don’t need the huge telescope lens unless you are going to take picture of the moon or lions from far. The bag it comes with are okay and so are the filter. The reason I’m giving 3 star review is because the little tripod broke on me and I email them just to get a reply a week later. The monopod is pretty bad.

Sometimes it makes all the sounds of snapping a photo but then you go to look at how it turned out and there is no photo.,I have a lot of experience with 35mm film SLR cameras and so it didn’t take long to learn to use the manual options.  I really like Shutter Priority mode (TV) for moving objects and Aperture Priority mode (AV) for still shots.

Love the features of this Nikon Coolpix B500.  I'm not a camera person but I love to take pix, and this works very well.  It's like a step above a point-and-click, but with a wonderful lens that can zoom in tight.  I bought this for my husband's birthday because he liked my other one so much that I figured he should have his own.  (not that I don't mind sharing, but when we're together and trying to take pix, seems to me that we should not have to wait our turn to use this great camera),I was particularly impressed with the whole bundle from this seller.  There are so many great accessories included that aren't normally with a camera purchase.  The bag is a really good camera bag that adjusts to hold virtually anything you'd need.  Love that they included both a large spider tripod and a short tripod.  Plus, they sent a 64gb memory card which was a very nice touch.  The cleaning kit was included as was a USB reader for the memory card.

I have been using Fuji for about 15 years and I switched to Nikon for a change. It contained most of the basic features as my Fuji except the eye lens. Please note: You are only able to take a picture using the display. If you need to see extreme detail, this may frustrate you. With a 40x zoom, you need an eye lens. I used the camera for about a week and a half. The image quality  is terrible and every image on a regular/auto setting is thoroughly washed out. If you utilize the dawn/dusk or sunset setting it drops a blue cast over the image which in some cases looks ridiculous, but without it, it would be too bright. There is no definition or depth to the images. It seem to me I get either washed out/unremarkable images or blue images. Glare is hard to avoid as well even with a darker setting. You don't see this glare until you download the larger image. I have provided images side by side. From L to R is a cell phone image, one on Auto and one on Dawn/Dusk. At least the cell image has no glare. An everyday user for everyday life, this is fine. Other than that, it has no use. It is my opinion that the reviews posted are fictitious. There is simply no way I could be getting these pictures based on REAL reviews. It doesn't make sense.","March 13, 2019",1.0 out of 5 stars,Carol A. Corsaro

This is a great camera for amateur photographers.  It is true to the advertisement.  It is a lot smaller than I expected, but I appreciate that it will be easier to slip into a purse when I travel.  Very comfortable to hold and use.  Straightforward features.  I would say the shutter (if that is the right word) is very slow.  So if you are setting up for a sudden photo op, you might miss it.  That is the reason I cannot give it five stars.  Also, I had a great customer service experience with Beach Camera.  Initially, when I got the camera, there was a defective European battery charger in the box, and for many reasons, it would be no good for a U.S. based customer.  Also, the batteries had already corroded.  It could be argued that someone should have caught it, but I understand mistakes happen.  I appreciate just how quickly they resolved the problem.  Thanks, Beach Camera!","May 25, 2018",4.0 out of 5 stars,Jambajan

Wish I had not bought this. Very disappointed in this Nikon. Enough so that my next purchase will be another brand altogether. *********This purchase was to replace my NikonCoolpix P510. Had that one for several years and finally the abuse caught up with it. I actually feel like I took a step down with this new camera. But, I have not used it a great deal yet so perhaps my opinion will change. I shot some video at a dog agility trial, even in good sun there was a bit of blur when I zoomed. One negative of note, the usb cable to allow me to upload directly to my pc is RIDICULOUSLY short. Too damn bad the usb cable from my old Nikon won't work with the new one. This camera is OK. Just not super.","November 3, 2018",1.0 out of 5 stars,Carolk9s

Stabilization, Touch Enabled 3-Inch LCD, Wi-Fi, DC-FZ80K (Black)","I'll probably only be able to update with more experience with it within a couple of months (1Q'14, when I'll be able to take a lot of real world situation photos, but here is what I tough so far from some tests.,I'm currently upgrading from a Canon SX20 IS and was considering Canon SX50 and Fujifilm X-S1 (both around $30-40 more expensive by the time of purchase). Since I tend to take a lot of photos indoor with poor illumination, some reviews I've read set my mind towards FZ70 and its 20mm wide.,What I like:,- 20mm wide: it allows me to cover a lot of width without having to step back much. My previous camera has 28mm and other cameras in this range has 24 or 25mm, tipically.,- 1200mm tele: SX50 has the same ammount of tele, but my SX20 maxes at 560mm.,- internal memory: not that I intend to run around without a SD card, but internal memory can be a life saver and it allowed for immediate photos after unpacking, since I didn't bought a new SD card (and my current one was very far).,- easy to open battery compartment: my SX20 has a battery compartment that is a bit tricky to open. On FZ70, you just slide a switch and it opens. Closing is just as easy.,- image quality: my main reason to upgrade. Of course, I fully expected a decent improvement since SX20 is a 2009 camera while FZ70 is 4 years newer. Still, it's quite noticeable when I looked at details while at 100% image size under low light.,What I disliked:,- Fixed lcd: SX20 has a variable angle lcd viewer (so does SX50), while FZ70 has a fixed one. I almost gave up on buying when I saw it didn't have a variable one, since it's so useful for selfies, seeing what is on it when the camera is too high or to low while mount on tripods and such.,- Proprietary USB connector: while most cameras allow USB connection by providing a mini-usb port, Panasonic decided to go with something else and so you're stuck with their cables.,- Battery: it was another factor that almost interfered with this choice. It's mostly personal preference, but I'd prefer if it used 4 AA batteries instead of a proprietary li-ion one. I use Sanyo Eneloops in my SX20 and have been happy with their duration (I can shoot 12h of video without needing to replace them). Also, I could buy some alcalines should necessity arises.,- No lens hood: it's a pity there are no lens hood in the box. My SX20 came with one. It's a cheap piece of plastic that'd be easy and inexpensive for Panasonic to add in the bundle.","December 9, 2013",4.0 out of 5 stars,RodIshiCi

It's a cheaper option for superzoom bridge cameras, so keep that in mind while you read about these pros and cons.,Pros:,- cheap for the technology, especially with the high zoom,- excellent 60X zoom,- clear, crisp pictures in good lighting,- fairly durable (mine has taken some hits),- small enough to fit in a backpack without too much worry,- wide angle lens and very good image stabilization,- has a decent viewfinder,- long battery life,- sensitive microphone for picking up audio,- able to have zoom even further increased with a telephoto adapter,Cons:,- the manual focus feature is a joke, it's practically unusable,- forget about manual settings too since it takes too much time to set,- it loves to autofocus on whatever is behind the subject,- the shutter speed is horribly slow (I've missed a ton of birds because of this),- mediocre in color and contrast,- practically useless in low light conditions (especially since you can't connect a remote shutter),- moisture has gotten in and appeared behind the lens on humid days,I still love this camera, but if I could go back in time I'd buy a Sony instead.","September 26, 2017",3.0 out of 5 stars,Logan

This part cannot take the wear and tear of opening and closing so the latch fails; then resorting to scotch taping it closed until I get a new camera. On this model of Sony cameras, they have taken great care to make the battery door spring loaded so that there is absolutely no stress or wear on the latch; It will not fail.

I have played around a bit with the WiFi and it seems straight forward.,The only complaint I have is that the lens shades when attached to the lens (both Canon lenses) is that the lens cap doesn't fit.

All I had to do with the zoom then was focus the end of it. Well treacherous crystal clear shots, zoom gets me closer to the critters, and the negation gets me crater shots of the moon. This camera is also lighter then the cannon Seri had in the 90's and I also YouTube's how to use the Bluetooth Wi-Fi with my phone to remotely take photos and receive them for Facebook.

The buttons feel very intuitive so far. Very pleased with the quality of the photos, especially close-up shots which I love to take.

The only thing I wish was different would be the sensor size, its a little too small, when zoomed in you will lose some clarity and definition, over all its an incredible camera for the price.","July 16, 2018",5.0 out of 5 stars,Garrison

It's quite a complex camera(at least for a digitally confused man), the instructions are relatively adequate, but going on to U-tube I was able to see some of the workings in action. Probably just how I learn better, see one do one kinda thing. But the photos are beautiful and when using a tripod I got some terrific shots of the moon that showed more than I'd been able to get with previous cameras. It has a multitude of scene variations as well as numerous programs that do most anything you would want a camera to do, from total automatic to total manual operation and anything in between.,I was able to purchase a factory refurb unit for a great savings, and I believe from the reviews and what I've experienced from the limited use so far I believe I found a real diamond in the rough !","July 10, 2015",5.0 out of 5 stars,Bill

Stabilization, Touch Enabled 3-Inch LCD, Wi-Fi, DC-FZ80K (Black)","My wife and I had been in the market for some time for a high-quality, relatively easy-to-use camera that would be especially great for non-professionals like us who like taking quality travel/nature photos and has good zoom.  We did not want to jump into the DSLR arena, but wanted to get shots as-close-as-possible.  After painstakingly researching media and reviews for all of the latest models in this category, I couldn't pass up the deal on this Lumix FZ70.,I have to say, I feel this camera is one of the best value purchases I've ever made.  First of all, the exterior fit, finish, and feel inspire immediate confidence, as the materials used and weightiness of the device exude quality.  Not chintzy at all.  I tested and compared the Canon SX50 in-store, and while that is also a very capable camera, the Lumix just feels and looks so much more high-quality in person.  Secondly, the ease of use and capability of taking great photos right out of the box, especially in iAuto mode was astonishing.  We were immediately taking awesome photos of our pets up close, and distant birds and squirrels out in the yard on full 60X zoom, with nice bokeh effect and great color and quality.  If the lighting outdoors leaves something to be desired, some of the quick post-processing effects can be implemented to immediately color-up, sharpen, brighten, etc to produce beautiful images with little effort.  Image stabilization is top-notch, as I have been able to take several long-zoom outdoor shots without a tripod with ease, just using simple technique tricks like using the viewfinder while bracing elbows against the body, etc.  Auto-focus is fast and accurate, burst shooting mode is also wonderful, as it greatly increases your odds of getting that perfect shot without any noticeable extra effort on your part.,Although I know there are many reviews that nit-pick on various things such as indoor photo quality, my use of the camera indoors has produced very good results, with a nice flash that doesn't wash out pictures at all.  I feel that for the average user who wants to shoot photos above the capabilities of the average point-and-shoot that appear 'professional' to 95% of viewers, you can't go wrong with this camera.  I have an aging Canon PowerShot SD1100IS small handheld that has taken some amazing photos for me through the last several years, and this Lumix FZ70 with its amazing zoom capabilities is the perfect natural progression to the next level.  At this price point, you can't go wrong.  Highly recommended!","March 20, 2014",5.0 out of 5 stars,Kyle

Stabilization, Touch Enabled 3-Inch LCD, Wi-Fi, DC-FZ80K (Black)","Had this less than a month. Had a dmc-fz10 before.  Very nice update.  Clear pictures, easy to use. Did take me some time to work out how to adjust manual exposure and such. The printed manual is very basic but finding some of the settings on the camera is not.  Amazing lens stabilization. I have a hand tremor and can still shoot at full zoom.  From macro to full tele, range is great and picture quality only limited by my talent, or lack thereof, as a photographer.  I don't want to have to haul around multiple lenses, but want to do most of what a full DSLR can do so this is an ideal camera. I'm not sure what the advantage would be of a DSLR.  I got a refurbished one for just over $200, and at that price it was well worth it. Not sure if would have paid full new retail price but even that is cheaper than decent DSLR.  Time will tell as to how it holds up. My old fz10 is still taking great pictures, 10 years on and I expect the same from this one.","September 4, 2014",5.0 out of 5 stars,WallyP

B01MRCWQRM,Nikon-26518-COOLPIX-A10,Nikon COOLPIX A10,"Upon receiving the camera, I could tell I wouldn't like it. It's very small. I put it away with the intent to use it right away, but kept leaving it at home. When I did get around to using it, I was not impressed with the quality of photos and just the overall functionality of it. I really wanted to like it, so I held on to it and told myself I just had to get used to it. I kept it in a camera bag with my other Kodak instant camera and when I took it out again to use it, the camera wouldn't work. The lens wouldn't open, somehow it got jammed. Not sure how because I took very good care of it and I kept it in the same bag with my Kodak and the Kodak works perfectly fine. Heck, I've even dropped my Kodak instant camera and it STILL works two years later. Luckily, I was still within my warranty window so I set up a repair. I returned the camera on May 21st and we are now in July and I have yet to get my camera back. I keep checking for repair updates and it's been in ""repair on hold"" status for weeks. Unfortunately, it's too late for me to return it and get my money back but I would if I could in a heartbeat. I purchased this camera with the intent on having a camera I could travel around with and take pictures instead of always using my phone since the phone battery dies out fast. I'm not a pro with camera's so I wanted something of good quality but affordable and easy to use.

B00I8BIC9E,Sony-DSCW800-Digital-Camera-Silver,Sony (DSCW800) 20.1 MP Digital Camera (Silver),The battery life for this camera was less than 2 hours.  I charged it overnight to be ready for my tours the next day.  After about 20 pictures the battery was at half strength and lasted for maybe another 20 pictures.  The older Sony camera batteries had at least 6-8 hours of constant picture taking.  I even bought extra batteries but they weren't any better.  It was terrible for my trip to Scandinavia.  Good thing I had my Ipad otherwise I wouldn't have had any pictures to share with my friends.  You would think that newer cameras would work better but this camera is proof that statement is incorrect.

B00I8BIC9E,Sony-DSCW800-Digital-Camera-Silver,Sony (DSCW800) 20.1 MP Digital Camera (Silver),Totally pleased with purchase!! Comes with three chords that when all put together Can be used to charge in the wall outlet. Then one chord can be used to charge in the computer. And one cord for the car.Super easy to use. To set up the camera is very simple and easy to figure out which button is which.It comes with a battery but no memory card the memory card I had to buy separately but it was not expensive and for the price of the camera I was not expecting it.It takes just your regular general memory card nothing fancy.The only issue I had with it was the arm strap. Even in the instructions it did not say how to attach it and we have yet to figure that out. So if someone could help us that would be great.The feature that helps you to get a focused picture even when you’re shaking a little bit works great.The instructions are pretty much basic and simple and so you may need to find out more information about it online.It works best for outdoor pictures I think. And the zoom is A very nice feature.They have continued to improve it in the past few years.It is lightweight but it has enough body to it to hold it easily when taking a picture.If there is no charge to the battery it takes approximately an hour to an hour and a half to charge.I purchased this camera for the purpose of taking outdoor nature pictures for the cards that I sell. And I am very pleased with the camera and so far think it is going to work great for that purpose. I would recommend this camera to anyone who just want something simple but well worth it with great quality.,"October 10, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,Joanna Burns

B00I8BIC9E,Sony-DSCW800-Digital-Camera-Silver,Sony (DSCW800) 20.1 MP Digital Camera (Silver),"I previously had a Canon S100, which was a good camera for me, but I damaged the racked out lens when it got bumped.  The S100 had worked well for me, but now is not available as new. I read the reviews of other cameras, and thought this Sony camera might be a good camera to use for shooting stills and video at concerts where the venue does not allow larger ""professional"" cameras.  I was very disappointed  in the auto focus function of this camera. It even has an auto-tracking selection where you are supposed to be able to pick a point in the frame to follow focus, but this was still not helpful in stills shooting, and did not seem to be an option for tracking focus in video shooting. I think my cell phone was a better choice for this purpose, but I had wanted a better optical zoom. This camera, despite the 5X zoom, still was not powerful enough to really get me the close ups I was looking for. I also has trouble with slow shutter speeds in a concert I took pix of, making horribly unusable photos. The menu also was not very intuitive.  Because of the focusing and slow shutter speed and menu issues, I promptly returned this for a refund, and received the refund quickly from Amazon.","August 23, 2018",2.0 out of 5 stars,Digster

That did not bother me since it takes great photos. I know some people complain of the slow shutter. This is not a camera I would be taking to a sporting event or concert or birthday party. This camera is perfect for sightseeing and landscapes.,As I have other more expensive cameras for that type of photography.  I just wanted something compact to take on airplane when traveling and when I was traveling light. To take nice pictures. You know sometimes you are traveling and do not have time to carry around a dedicated camcorder and a hybrid point and shoot and a dslr.

She was so happy and satisfied for this.She needed one to make videos on her youtube channel. She is not  professional and so didn't feel she needed a professional camera. This camera is not a professional camera, but has some nice features for an amateur. It's definitely not bad for the price and gets the job done. If you are looking for a professional camcorder however, this is not the one to get.

Stabilization, Touch Enabled 3-Inch LCD, Wi-Fi, DC-FZ80K (Black)","To fully enjoy the use of this camera,  YOU NEED TO READ THE MANUALS, BOTH OF THEM.  YOU NEED TO DOWNLOAD THE ADVANCED MANUAL AND READ IT.  This camera has amazing capabilities.  The zoom capabilities without reverting to the use of the digital zoom are awe-inspiring.  The Intelligent Zoom is better than a digital zoom, and it extends the zoom capabilities to more than the 60x figure.  I have used both.  The intelligent zoom will give you a photo with fewer megapixels, but the distortion common to digital zooming is missing.  Since you're starting with 16.1 mp, you can well afford to reduce the mp for the purpose of getting a long shot, but you don't even have to do that if you use the zoom attachment you can purchase with the adapter.,I also have the adapter for the zoom attachment and the close-up attachment.  I was using a FZ100, and the same accessories work.  For the record,  you can use the regular zoom AND the intelligent zoom with the telephoto attachment which allows you to get magnificent zoom capabilities without using a digital zoom.,This camera also has good wide angle capabilities as well - at least as wide as I ever want.  It doesn't do fisheye.,It has macrofocusing down to 1 mm AND macro zoom focusing, which is delightful and will enlarge the subject.  And I have the close-up attachment as well, although so far the macro zoom has produced pictures I'm happy with, so I haven't used it.  .,It has many different focusing choices.  You need to see what they are and see which one works for you.  The flexible focus is my favorite.  Uses a bit more battery, but it is faster continuous focus than the one labeled continuous focus.  This is why you have to read the directions.  There is also manual focus.  And standard focus.,They have skimped on not making the vewing screen moveable to different angles.  If you want to take a time exposure, you mght want to use the timed shutter release to avoid camera movement, since there is no input for an external shutter button.  And yes, those things would have been nice, BUT I couldn't afford the camera if they hadn't kept the price down.  This is a hobby of mine, not a profession.,This is one whopper of a camera for the price.  I think they economized in the right places and spent the money on the best kind of image stabilization that you can get - a necessity if you are going to use such a zoom.,I have set my camera to limit the shutter speeds (found in the camera menu settings) so that it can't automatically go to too slow a speed.  Panasonic recommends a tripod -- and it's very true that a good tripod helps - but ninety nine percent of the time, when I want a photo, I either don't have my tripod with me, or it's not set up -- so I am handholding shots that should be on a tripod -- because the deer will leave -- or the birds or small animals are active -- I'm often taking a walk, and I use the zoom to photograph wild flowers I can't get close to without getting into poison ivy or some such thing.,My advice for handheld shots is to use the shutter speed limit, so the shutter speed can't go too slow on you.  I often use shutter priority, risking the shot being too dark, but there is also an option in the setup stuff. Often, even if a picture is too dark, you can improve it with software.,The camera also had editing capabilities, but I use Corel's software on my PC.,I take LOTS OF PHOTOS.  If you think you can't hand hold the camera, snap as many photos as you can, and try.  Hold your breath and get your elbows close to your sides -- really - it steadies you -- or find something to lean on, if possible, and do your best.  Sometimes it doesn't work, but often if I take a lot of photos, at least a couple of them will be sharp, because I snapped the picture at just the right moment.,The beauty of digital photography is that you don't have to pay for your flops.  You can just delete them, and keep the good ones.,This is not a professional photographer's camera, although I would bet that pros would have one whopper of a good time with it.  But I don't have the money to buy a pro's camera, nor do I have the ability to carry the camera equipment I used to -- nor do I have the money to spare for excessive film and processing.,SO I am as happy as a hog in a mud waller with this camera.  It take good pictures.  As with any camera, you need to get used to this particular one.  I have a particular combination of metering and exposure that I usually use -- you could vary your choices to suit yourself, BUT YOU WON'T DO THAT IF YOU DON'T DOWNLOAD THE ADVANCED MANUAL AND READ IT.,I went to the trouble to print out the manual, because I studied it in odd places in order to cover the information.  It is convenient to have it on your computer, too, but I wanted a print out.  I printed it one section at a time.,This is a wonderful camera for the money.  If I could afford the setup the National Geographic photographers use, I wouldn't be able to carry it anyway.  This camera is a great deal of fun, and if you will take the time to master the vast number of choices you have available, you will surely enjoy it.,I highly recommend it.","July 12, 2014",5.0 out of 5 stars,whippersnapper

The default iA setting produces sharp photos and videos, far superior to my Samsung Galaxy 2 (phone), iPhone 4, and assorted cheap 16MP Canon and Nikon cameras. The picture quality is comparable to and possibly even better than from the Canon 16MP D5100 that costs more than twice as much. Some people may be put off by its light weight and plastic body; it feels solid enough for my needs.  The camera works well in low light, occasionally I got a warning to pop open the flash. I simply pressed a button to do that, and viola the flash fired without requiring any setting changes. Because it is light, compact, yields quality results and is not expensive I am likely to pack it on every trip.","March 1, 2014",5.0 out of 5 stars,Chani Pangali

On a bright, sunny day, with the sun overhead, or behind you, no matter how much you turn up the view screen, you'll have trouble seeing much.

This camera takes the best quality picture at 18 Mega pixels. It also has 8X zoom feature which is really great. I have uploaded couple of sample pictures that I have taken with this camera. I am not a professional photographer but this digital camera is so awesome that anyone can become a photographer. It is very easy to carry around this camera and this camera is better than other bulky and expensive cameras. So far I am using it without any problems and enjoying taking pictures with this camera. It comes with the software CD for editing, printing and sharing photos. I haven't used that software because I use another software for that purpose.

This one seemed to fit the bill, but I was surprised because of the price being so low. We used this on a trip to Washington, but also took some pictures around the house. The pictures came out surprisingly well! Each file is about 1 to 2 megabytes in size, and the videos are as long as you take a video. The video was what surprised my daughter the most, who takes tons of pictures. She has a $800 camera, but doesn't always like to take it out while we are walking. She used this one the entire trip and was very happy with it. It is not grainy like some other cameras, and takes very nice pictures. Not blow up 2 wall size quality, but you could blow it up to a small poster and be very happy. Specially if your picture is still. It is a solid camera, and feels like it will stand up. And for the price, you cannot beat it. It does take a SD card and not a micro SD card, but nowadays that is not a problem because they all come with adapters. We are actually going to keep this in our car for when we take short trips that way we always have it with us.","July 29, 2019",5.0 out of 5 stars,rg

It zooms well, however when you zoom if you do it too close it does appear to be a little fuzzy. Maybe I just can't figure out how to use it properly, it's been a long time since I have used a real camera and not an iPhone. Overall I think this was a great product and a good price point.

But the image quality is truly amazing. I will upload a few customer images of my hiking trip as an example. An SD card is absolutely necessary, the internal storage can only hold 3 maximum quality images.I did have one problem with the camera, the battery that came with it refused to take a charge. Amazon made up for this by offering me a 40% refund to buy a new battery, and the battery was much cheaper than the $31 refund I got so this issue wasn't even reason enough to take a star off. Overall great camera and great customer service from Amazon.I've only owned this for a month and only used it for 2 days for a hiking trip so I can't speak on long term survival of this camera.

Though my phone can shoot great photos and videos, I like the appeal of simple point and shoot camera like this one. The image and video quality is decent, it would be foolish to compare it with a DSLR. I guess it works well as an introductory camera for kids. I remember my first digital camera when I was a teenager, it reminded me of those days. Good value when bought with discounts or coupons. I wish it came with a sd card though. This camera made me nostalgic and I am thinking of gifting it to my 10 year old nephew. I think he will love it. Flash is super bright, night mode is bit grainy but okay.  I do not do much digital zoom, but it works. Display is basic and bit laggy, so viewing on desktop would be wiser. Very simple camera, very handy, can have it as a back up or can use it just for fun.

B07KSXT9NH,GordVE-Digital-Backpacking-Cameras-Photography,"GordVE 2.7 Inch Digital Camera, HD Camera for Backpacking, Mini Digital Camera Pocket Cameras Digital with Zoom, Compact Cameras for Photography","The description leads you to believe that this isn't a pro level camera and it isn't. However, it does make for an excellent first-time camera for my kids. The focus and flash work very well and while the photos may tend to be a little pixelated if you zoom too much, it's very adequate otherwise. Battery charge holds for a good time. Since the video is 720p, it's not going to provide UHD level quality but the playback suited the kids just fine. Great deal for the features you get.","July 3, 2019",5.0 out of 5 stars,Scott Ernst

B00I8BIC9E,Sony-DSCW800-Digital-Camera-Silver,Sony (DSCW800) 20.1 MP Digital Camera (Silver),I thought since the camera was a 20.1mp it would be a great camera but my iPhone 6S Plus takes better photos. The photos are not clear and a lot of the time it’s blurry. It’s not operator error either I’ve used many cameras and never have they been as bad as this one.

B00I8BIC9E,Sony-DSCW800-Digital-Camera-Silver,Sony (DSCW800) 20.1 MP Digital Camera (Silver),"We got this camera for a 7 year old. It's compact and easy to use, but takes at least a second to respond after you press the shutter button. It also tends to select slow exposures (like 1/30 sec), even when using the flash. And it often simply does not focus. The result is that around 2/3 of the photos from it are either badly out of focus or show motion blur. It's frustrating because our daughter has a knack for photography and loves having her own camera, but this one is thwarting her efforts. I don't know if there are any good cameras in this price range; this one is pretty much a waste of money.","November 4, 2018",2.0 out of 5 stars,David MacKenzie

B00I8BIC9E,Sony-DSCW800-Digital-Camera-Silver,Sony (DSCW800) 20.1 MP Digital Camera (Silver),"Before I begin, my previous camera was a Sanyo vpcT1496R 14MP camera.,The people that say their phones are better either have brand new phones, which some of them come with 13MP+ cameras....or got a defective camera.,This is a good camera. I can actually use the zoom and it isn't always a blurry blob. (It can still be a blurry blob depending on settings, but it doesn't have to be) I haven't really messed with any settings. I've put it to where the display shows standard and not the actual quality of the photo to save battery, and the pictures still look way better than my old camera. I can't wait to someday go to the zoo and take pictures with this thing.,The battery life is fine.,I bought this from Focus Camera on Amazon. I mention this due to the one problem. I got the European version and I live in America. It came with a European charger which isn't compatible with American plugs. It came with an adapter that isn't even listed in the parts that can come with the camera....which means this could've been a used camera (albiet one that was taken care of) since someone had to open it to add the adapter that doesn't come with it. The adapter could be a POS and cause problems. Amazon did fix it by letting me order a charger and refunding me the amount (Amazon, not the seller). Note: the authentic looking chargers (the ones that look like the one it was supposed to come with) are the ones where you take the battery out to charge it. Which I dislike because that means every charge....gotta put the date in and everything (warning for those who get the correct charger),Minus the charger thing, it's a good camera. It's fairly cheap as well. Sony usually has good quality in their electronics, though you can always get a dud.,Edit: Since reviewing this, things have changed: This thing is flimsy. Out of NOWHERE the part that pushes out and pulls in the lens broke so now the camera refuses to do anything beyond tell me to turn it off and on again. So I can't suggest you buy this camera unless it's the only half decent one in your price range.","February 28, 2016",2.0 out of 5 stars,Yokuutsu

Try as I may, I just am not getting good pictures from this camera. I don't expect super quality, but my dear departed Canon Powershot in the same price range did a far superior job with both clarity, contrast, focus,speed of picture storage, and every other aspect of picture taking.  It is far too late to return it, so it will end up in a drawer somewhere, or I will give it to a child wanting a first camera. I can't recommend this camera.","July 12, 2018",2.0 out of 5 stars,Retired Viking
B01MRCWQRM,Nikon-26518-COOLPIX-A10,Nikon COOLPIX A10,"I ordered this elsewhere because my other digital camera I have been using since 2010 finally kicked the bucket.  I needed something with better megapixels anyhow.  My Canon PowerShot went up to 10MP.  Since this one has 16MP and was very affordable, I decided to give it a whirl.,Great pictures, easy to use, nice features, but one thing that still baffles my mind...NO CABLE!  You mean to tell me for $80+, you couldn't throw in a $5 USB cord?  I'm sorry, but that's awfully cheap of Nikon.  Even my dinky camera from seven years ago included one.  So I had to make, yet, another purchase in order to transfer the pictures onto my PC.  Even though you have a card reader as an alternative solution, I don't know anybody in the world that has one.,I'd also like to mention that, every time you replace the batteries, the darn thing resets back to default, meaning the date and such has to be reprogrammed.  The self-timer doesn't stay.  I have to keep setting it for every single picture.  Again, my last camera didn't do this.  As well, the tripod mount on the bottom is too far to the left, which can cause it to tip over if not balanced correctly.,Overall, it's okay, but come on Nikon, give your customers a cable.  Don't make them go out of their way to purchase something extra for whatever oddball reason you see fit not to include something that's essentially required in order to make full use of your product.","October 22, 2017",3.0 out of 5 stars,Mike C.

Stabilization, Touch Enabled 3-Inch LCD, Wi-Fi, DC-FZ80K (Black)","I bought this camera for the zoom range, and I am very pleased with that aspect. However, a couple of other things could be improved. For example, the burst rate/buffering is pretty limited. Rapid fire shots (like I am used to doing with my DMC-FZ200) are limited to 2-3 and then there's a substantial wait until the buffer is flushed to the disk. This effectively forces me to be very selective about when I push the release button, especially when I'm shooting action scenes. Another issue is the fixed monitor screen, which isn't much help when the camera is pointed at the sky. Again, I'm spoiled, I suppose, by the FZ200's rotating display. Another surprise came when I tried to take some long exposure night sky shots and found that the camera controls the limits on ISO and shutter speed. This was in P mode, so I need to do some more experimentation before I give up on using it for these sorts of shots.","October 18, 2013",4.0 out of 5 stars,R. Simpson

With a teleconverter you can get out to P900 range but you have to use a tripod. The image stabilization is far less capable than Nikon's. The android app is particularly useful when using a tripod, even allowing for control of focus. It puts the Nikon app to shame.,The best teleconverter I've found is the Olympus B-300 1.7x which can be found on ebay. Its lightweight enough that it can be attached directly to the lens without using an adapter. Just understand that your image stabilization doesn't work when you do that, and you'll need to use a tripod.

The major criticism I have thus far is that the writing on the buttons is already wearing off, despite treating the camera gingerly.  I've had the camera less than 3 months and one button is illegible already.  Very disappointed with that aspect.  Also, soon after my purchase, the lens cap fell apart while attaching it.  One of the tiny springs shot out, never to be found, so the cap no longer stays on the lens.  I've never had similar problems with my Nikon and Canon products.,EDIT:  10/6  - I have to lower my rating again at this point.  The sticker trim that's around the lens has begun pealing off.  I've not even used the camera in a few weeks.  Took it out of its case and it's hanging off.  Can't be ""stuck"" back on readily.  I think Panasonic really cut corners on the fit and finish of this camera.

They were small and great price and took incredible photos. I avoided buying a DSLR just because they took such good photos. So when I saw this Lumix FZ70, I thought wow, this is going to be a great camera. I didn't like the larger size, but it sounded like it would have such great options and who could pass up that 60X zoom! Sadly, I have been disappointed. In fact I was taking photos at an event with this new camera, and the action photos were so bad, I ended up pulling out my little Lumix DMC-ZS25 and used it to take my photos. We read through the big on-line manual to see how we could take better photos, but to no avail. Absolutely cannot take action shots with this camera. The subjects are always out of focus. The IA setting was useless. We even went to the manual settings, trying every combination, but again no luck. I had bought this to take action shots of dogs running in agility competition. My little Lumix ZS25 camera did such a great job but got dust on the sensor and it would cost more than the price of the camera to fix. So we bought this one as a replacement and sorry we did. Can't return it because the instructions say you can only return unopened products. Of course we opened it. We used it.

Had found out that the Navy photographers used Canon products and that was enough for me.  That was a used one and heavy....After my retirement, I bought a Canon Rebel which I still have.  (uses film so ..).  My next purchase was a Canon Elph which takes excellent pictures.  And,now this one!,The vision in my right eye has deteriorated and the Elph screen was a little small for me to see the scene like I wanted.  I love to take pictures and decided to purchase this one.  The quality of pictures is excellent, it is easy to use and the battery life is good, so far.  I have taken over 60 pictures and haven't had to charge the battery yet.,I am still in the learning mode but the camera reminds me of the first Canon I owned in the early 1970's.  The service representatives at Canon are outstanding.  I had to call them with the ""Elph'"" once when I couldn't get the pictures to transfer to the PC.  Most patient with me when I told them I was visually impaired.,This one comes with a small tripod, a nice case plus a few other accessories.  When the eagles soar overhead this summer,  I am in hopes of catching them in flight.  Plus, I live in the 'boonies' so lots of wildlife around my cabin.  Will definitely come back and edit this review if anything changes with this camera.,One other thing is that I don't have a cell phone as they don't work in the area that I live.  So, am unable to make a comparison with a cell phone.,Excellent, just excellent and I couldn't be more pleased with this Canon camera and my purchase.,Edited to add a couple of pictures taken the other night.  The first one is without magnification and the second picture is with the 50 X.  Am still learning the functions on the camera and having a lot of fun in the hills of Vermont...  And, hoping the full moon event will be a clear night...,Most highly recommended.","June 6, 2019",5.0 out of 5 stars,Serenity...

B00HNJWUBI,Sony-DSCW830-Digital-Camera-2-7-Inch,Sony DSCW830 20.1 MP Digital Camera with 2.7-Inch LCD (Silver),"As a former professional photographer, I was seriously underwhelmed by this camera. For $120, you'd expect something that would, at the very least, produce sharp images. This one doesn't. But there are times when I don't want, or can't, or didn't bring along my big Nikons with all of my interchangeable lenses, filters, lens hoods and tripods; times when I simply want something small, portable to take quick images, to record a place I might want to lug all of my equipment back to, or simply to quickly record an event. Well...I spent a week testing the DSC W830, both indoors and outdoors. I do mostly nature and wildlife photography, not people. I don't need a camera that detects smiles or faces: trees, rocks, mountains, wildflowers, and squirrels don't smile! I just wanted something to take some quick, but sharp images. The autofocus on this camera is less accurate than expected. And though it supposedly focuses at about five centimeters (two inches), this unit did a very poor job. Frankly, the camera in a smartphone can do a better job.","September 14, 2017",2.0 out of 5 stars,Robert

Stabilization, Touch Enabled 3-Inch LCD, Wi-Fi, DC-FZ80K (Black)","I wanted a super zoom bridge camera because I take a lot of bird photos but couldn't justify the cost of upgrading to a DSLR right now.  Before I bought the LUMIX, I had been using a Fujifilm SL300, which I loved but which didn't quite have the power I wanted at 30x zoom.  The Panasonic camera has mostly met my expectations, with clear optics for the zoom (with a tripod, of course) and options for manual settings that allow me to tweak my shots.  The Intelligent Auto setting is surprisingly good in selecting the correct settings for the scene you're shooting, although it doesn't always give me what I want, hence the need for the manual settings.  With a 60x optical zoom and macro lens settings, this camera gives me both power and versatility.,Some reviewers have mentioned how big it is, and because I couldn't find it in stores, I was nervous.  I was relieved to discover that it's NOT big for a bridge camera, only in comparison to a point-and-shoot.  The LUMIX is the same size as my Fujifilm, just with a wider lens.  There's a bump out on the right for gripping with a nice area for my thumb on the back of the case -- we lefties have always had to adjust for a mostly righty world, and I have no issue holding the camera with my right hand.  I'm not going to stash this inside of a handbag, but then again, I didn't expect to.  When I'm using this, I wear it around my neck or over my shoulder.,The LUMIX has too many features to include in a customer review; however, several of them are worth noting, especially for those who want to use this as more than a point-and-shoot:  manual settings for aperture and shutter speed; the ability to program shift; focus locking; the option to switch from LED screen to traditional viewfinder; pop-up flash; shoe for separate flash; continuous (""burst"") shooting mode, with or without autofocus, up to nine shots.  Point-and-shooters will be familiar with the scene options, and, of course, the camera also takes video, although I never use it for that.  I also never use the ""creative control"" feature since, if I really wanted special effects, I'd do it on my computer, not with the camera itself.  Although anyone can pick up and use this camera, it takes some practice to get used to the settings and features for a more enhanced photography experience.  Don't expect the LUMIX DMC-FZ70 to equal a DSLR, but do expect it to be much better than a point-and-shoot.  My only disappointment, and hence the half-star deduction, is the inability to use a remote shutter.  Most people won't care about this; however, for bird photography, I could really use it at times.,The camera comes with a battery (buy a spare!), a wall charger, a lens cap, and a neck strap.  You'll have to buy a case if you want to protect it and don't already have one.  And don't forget the memory card.,In comparison to the Fujifilm I already owned, the Panasonic is almost interchangeable except for the zoom power.  Both are excellent bridge cameras with roughly the same size and features.  The stability feature on the Panasonic might be slightly better, and it includes a few extra options; however, I consider them to be comparable cameras.  The real issue is deciding on the maximum optical zoom power and whether you need it.,-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann","August 6, 2015",5.0 out of 5 stars,Debbie Lee Wesselmann

In fact the only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because I have to ""find"" the new features the manual could be better in explaining all the camera does.

I miss the little view finder window (or whatever it's called). On this camera you need to use the display window to frame your shot and sometimes in bright light it is nearly impossible to do this. Also I notice that pictures taken with full zoom are not clearly focused even with a solid support of the camera to eliminate shaking. But it works and you don't need to worry about batteries since it is rechargeable. I just used the 1GB card from the old camera and that is enough for 195 pictures set on the highest (""L) setting, or 24 minutes of video (8 minutes of HD video). This is more than enough for my needs. I can't imagine why anyone would need anything bigger.

Better than mobile phone quality picture (If you are mobile phone photographer NVM),4. Good battery life.

The image stabilization is good if you only have minor movement and the zoom works pretty well. The camera struggle a little in low lighting but most shot footage outside which worked great.

B07QG2HSJ5,Digital-Cameras-Teenagers-Beginners-Travel-Outdoors,"HD Mini Digital Cameras,Point and Shoot Digital Cameras for Kids Teenagers Beginners-Travel,Camping,Outdoors,School (Red 1)","I’m a fairly lazy person when it comes to returns, but I’m actually returning this purchase. To be fair to the company, shipping was much faster than expected which was great since I purchased this for my impatient 6 year old. However, quality of the product is FAR below the reviews. The camera is very cheaply made and feels like it’ll break in your hands at any moment. There is a switch on the side of the camera that changes between close up and scenic views that feels like it’s going to break the whole camera every time I use it. The camera never focused for any image (I’m experienced with photography and couldn’t get it to focus) and after fully charging the battery for over 15 hours it died after only 3 pictures. I would strongly urge you to reconsider purchasing this product and go with a better known proven point and shoot. For the time being my 12 year old Olympus point and shoot is still a significantly better option for my son and I’m disappointed that I even gave this a try.","July 22, 2019",1.0 out of 5 stars,MMS

There are so many features that I will have to study the manual for a while to know how to use them all. I can hardly wait to take this camera on my next trip. I should get some amazing nature pictures. Zoom is 60x for optical and another 60x for digital (120x). Wide angle is 20 mm and it zooms out to 1200mm at full extension. I looked at various cameras with a mega zoom feature including the Canon SX50. This Lumix has most of the features of the Canon as well as a few extra, a larger optical zoom (60x as opposed to 50x on the Canon) and is priced about $35 less than the Canon.

The center of the frame was decent (although not as sharp as I'd like), but the entire 360 degrees in the rest of the frame was blurry.  I played around with all the focus, resolution, and ""scene"" settings, but the results were consistently poor.  I'd say 1 picture in 5 was borderline acceptable -- the rest were not.,I'm just a family guy (not a photographer), and was looking for an affordable point-and-shoot camera.  This was certainly affordable, but the indoor pictures are bad enough that I'm returning this camera.","February 22, 2015",2.0 out of 5 stars,Adam Jansons

I think I set my expectations a little too high though. The camera itself is nicely made; light and small enough to fit in my tiny woman hands. But i wouldn't call this a professional camera. It takes quality pictures most of the time but sometimes I feel as if I NEED a tripod to take second pictures. Especially if the lighting isn't perfect or its dark out. I've taken beautiful close up pictures of full moons with this camera and it's given me plenty of stunning pictures for my cousins wedding. But when I have tried to take far away night shots, you definitely need a steady hand because it doesn't seem to focus nearly as well as during the day. It's a nice little camera for beginners but I wouldn't recommend for someone who's trying to do photo shoots.

B07P2PJX7N,Digital-Cameras-Point-Cameras-Travel-Camping,"HD Mini Digital Cameras,21MP Point and Shoot Digital Video Cameras-Travel,Camping,Gifts (Black 1)","This was for my daughter - a camera cheap enough that I wouldn't cry too much if it got lost or stolen.,So I wasn't expecting much.,I did expect it to work all the time. In 30 minutes of trying, I got 2. After which it totally froze both times.,And those were the times it didn't:,Turn off as soon as you pressed the shutter,Screen turned solid blue (been a long time since I've seen a BSOD) upon trying to format the memory card,Went to a solid crosshatch and was unresponsive,Just turned right back off as soon as it powered on.,Turned on and froze and wouldn't turn off unless you held the power down for 10 seconds.,Turned on and froze and wouldn't turn off unless even if you held the power button for 30 seconds, requiring a battery pull.,The battery was horrible tight, and there's no way you can get fingers in, nor could you do even the gentlest of taps to help it out a little, because the skinny, flimsty, waiting-to-be-broken-off battery cover hinges on the narrow side, making it super weak. Luckily, I hadn't trimmed my nails in a few days...,Repeat ad nauseum for a full 30 minutes.,Then it let me take 2 pictures.,Well, maybe I won't right a stinker of review if the pics are OK.,They're awful, look at the grain, blurriness - and this only at ISO 640!,If this was 10 years ago, it'd be fine.,But I can spend $40 and get a action camera with WiFi, with a waterproof case, that I bought because I wanted something I was less afraid to take risks with. It's been to Hawaii, snorkeling, it's been on a 30ft selfie stick tacking pictures in a factory, mountain biking, hung out the side of a convertible - flawless. And the image quality on that is MUCH better.,The only reason I got this instead, is that the action cam is a fixed, super-wide fisheye - not great for photography, but fine for oddball landscapes or action shots - it's pretty niche.,The unreliability I can forgive, but I know what the bathtub curve is and sometimes it just sucks to be one of the people at the top, on the start of that graph.,But this is 2005 CMOS camera quality. I dunno how the heck everyone else can think this is passable quality. A dirt-cheap 'burner' phone does better. A lot better.","August 2, 2019",1.0 out of 5 stars,Ian
B07P2PJX7N,Digital-Cameras-Point-Cameras-Travel-Camping,"HD Mini Digital Cameras,21MP Point and Shoot Digital Video Cameras-Travel,Camping,Gifts (Black 1)","Smaller is definitely NOT better - especially when it comes to inexpensive electronics.  To begin with, the micro-font instruction manual states that the package includes a digital camera, ProTags Express Software Installation CD, USB cable, User's instruction manual, Strap, Camera bag, Lithium battery, and a charger.  There is no CD nor is there a charger in the kit.  In fact, I called Amazon to send a second camera for the missing parts, and they were not in the second shipment either.  Second, it is nearly impossible to configure the camera with optimum settings.  I am not unfamiliar with cameras and electronics, but I had trouble paging through the settings.  I even had a highly skilled techie friend try to set up the camera and the best we could get out of any of the pictures were grainy shots less than 2 megabytes.  This product is not worth the time it takes to open the box. Don't waste your money. No way this camera shoots a 21 MP image.

B07KSXT9NH,GordVE-Digital-Backpacking-Cameras-Photography,"GordVE 2.7 Inch Digital Camera, HD Camera for Backpacking, Mini Digital Camera Pocket Cameras Digital with Zoom, Compact Cameras for Photography","This is my first full Digital camera I have ever had. I always loved photography, and I have been using all kinds of different types of smartphone and tablets for taking pictures. While lots of those handheld mobile devices did very good at taking pictures, this it DSC-W800 beats all the smartphone and tablet cameras especially with the image processing like (exposure etc.) Also the 5x Optical Zoom is awesome lots of smartphone cameras don't have any Optical Zoom and the ones that do are very limited on the distance because of the focal length. Most new high end smartphone cameras have 1x-2x Optical Zoom which is barely noticeable. And digital zoom just sucks. So coming from tablets and smartphone cameras I have to say this is my best first digital camera I have ever had! The camera has auto focus, 5x Optical Zoom, has a proprietary USB cable for data transfer and changing. The pictures are very good which I will attach in this review.","February 24, 2019",5.0 out of 5 stars,AmazonCustomer

Works great for her. Images are not great but she doesn't care. If you are looking for quality pictures you want to get something better but just for fun and so a kid can see what they take pictures of it's fine. Images tend to be dark and overexposed. Changing the sharpness to soft made them easier to look at. For the most part they are clear. Zoom gets a pretty blurry.

Stabilization, Touch Enabled 3-Inch LCD, Wi-Fi, DC-FZ80K (Black)","I have a very lengthy history with point and shoot cameras. I am a professional photographer so I suppose that I am spoiled by DSLR quality however Panasonic has never let me down. I bought a Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS3 when it first came out. I was thoroughly impressed with the quality for the price that I had paid. Concert videos came out great and a lot of the photos were really good too. I still have that Lumix and my son now uses it.,After dabbling with DSLRs for a while I decided that I wanted a more professional level point and shoot. I bought a Canon G12 and while it had some impressive features it just was not what I expected from the reviews I had seen. It was okay during concerts (one of the main reasons I have a point and shoot) but it wasn't something I was excited to use. After I sold the Canon I went to a Nikon Coolpix. I am an avid Nikon fan. That is the only DSLR I shoot with so I figured the point and shoot would be just as good. I was wrong. The quality of the photos was horrible and I couldn't get a clear shot to save my life. The Coolpix quickly went back. I stuck with the Panasonic Lumix ZS3 for a while and then went to a Nikon N1 J3. Again, not great. I did not like how it handled but I have kept it around for a year.,I was browsing reviews for cameras that are great for my upcoming trip to Disney. I saw this Lumix FZ70 listed so I did some more research. After reading reviews here on Amazon as well as other sources such as Ken Rockwell I decided that I would jump on the low price that I paid. Yet again Panasonic did NOT disappoint. I got the camera this morning so I have not been able to fully test it and will definitely update when I do, but from what I have done so far today...IMPRESSIVE. The zoom is ridiculous and much clearer than I expected it to be at 1200mm!,Below I posted a macro shot (holy crap!) and also posted a shot where the lens was at the shortest and then the longest length to show the power of the zoom. In the shot where you can see the entire street I put a red circle around the car that I zoomed in on. The red circle is in the center of the photo, far far down the street. I cannot wait to get out there and test this camera's capabilities in Disney in a few months and then at a concert in May.","February 17, 2015",5.0 out of 5 stars,Krystle

Awesome zoom.  The quality of the pictures are also quite good.  You can digitally zoom up by quite a bit and still have resolution adequate for printing.  It has lots of bells and whistles that I've yet to start digging in.  On the down side, It feels like it would probably break if I dropped it from a foot.  I've been careful so far.

But the shutter button is far too sensitive. You can just brush your finger by it and take a photo. You don't need to press it. So you cannot press it halfway to focus first. It just focuses on whatever it wants to - which is 99% of the time not what you want it to focus on. The photo quality is terrible. I'm no professional, but I know what I'm doing with a camera and even I cannot get a photo in good focus. And you can accidently brush the shutter button and end up taking 2-4 photos in a row without meaning to... you don't have to press, take a photo, press, take a photo. You can press press press (not meaning to do it multiple times) and get photo taken, photo taken, photo taken... all slightly delayed but one after another... if that makes sense.

When I unwrapped the camera, it appeared smaller than I expected but that was a good thing. It had a great feel in my hand and I was looking forward to trying it out. I went through all the steps in the instruction manual, attaching the straps, downloading the bluetooth app for my phone, installing the 64G card that came with it and the batteries. I turned the camera on, I was led through instructions on connecting my phone with the camera via bluetooth. I accomplished a connection and moved to the next screen which was ""Turn off the camera and then turn it back on"". Which I did...many many times, each time it would only return to the same message to restart the camera. I even removed the batteries and restarted it twice only to the same effect so I asked for a refund. I was sent an RMA label but it cost me 34.00 more dollars to send it back since it was not a prepaid label. so my rating is more for the experience and not for the way the camera works, obviously.

B00I8BIBCW,Sony-DSCW800-Digital-Camera-Black,Sony DSCW800/B 20.1 MP Digital Camera (Black),"After reading the positive reviews and seeing the price, I decided to purchase this camera for a trip. It's very easy to use out of the box. Simply install the battery and your memory card and start using. The memory card is sold separately. As an amateur photographer, I loved how easy it was to snap pictures. All you have to do is aim and press the button. I was also impressed with the battery. My first digital camera was a Kodak that required Double-A's, which ran down very quickly. I used over three dozen batteries on that trip, which wasn't cheap. That wasn't the case with the battery. I never once had to recharge it during my 1.5 week trip. The reason I give it three stars is because of the picture quality and the screen. The screen was hard to view in a variety of lights because it was dim. The picture quality was too light, and some of them came out soft and blurry, even when I was standing still. That said, I managed to get some good shots that I was able to improve with Photoshop. I love the compact design, which is perfect for traveling.","August 3, 2014",3.0 out of 5 stars,Deborah Woehr

Stabilization, Touch Enabled 3-Inch LCD, Wi-Fi, DC-FZ80K (Black)","I've had this camera for a couple of weeks now and have shot about 1500 photos with it.  I wanted a bridge camera that had a longer zoom than my fz200, didn't break the bank and was small and light enough to actually keep with me.  At 60x, fz70 has almost twice the optical zoom of my fz200 and I can still use the doubling lens I bought for the fz200 once I purchase an adapter if I need more than a 1200mm zoom.  Don't get me wrong, I love the fz200, the low light capabilities of the fz70 doesn't compare but the 60x zoom is nothing short of amazing.  The picture quality is fine for my needs (snapshots, travel photos, birding shots) and the camera is light enough to keep in my backpack.  I am a novice birder and the ability to get a decent picture of a bird a good distance away is helping me learn to id what I was missing before.  I am more than happy with this camera.,Pros:,- Did I mention it has a 60x optical zoom?,- Small enough to keep with me.  Can't get great pics if the camera is sitting at home.,- Picture quality is decent.  Not as good as the fz200 but you don't pay as much for this camera either.,Cons:,- Battery life.  Not great.  Can be extended by dimming the screen and turning off the setting to keep the focus motor going.,- File name conflicts.  Since I own two Panasonic cameras I have to be creative when importing photos.  There is no way to alter the file naming convention of PXXXXXXX.JPG so it is easy to overwrite files if both cameras are being used.  There is a site online that tells how to jump ahead in the numbering schema but that is just putting off the problem. [...]  I've resorted to uploading the files from this camera to a specific folder then running a script to change the filename from PXXXXXX.JPG to QXXXXXX.JPG.  An extra step I wish I didn't have to remember to do.","May 13, 2014",4.0 out of 5 stars,Kerry

Also whenever you take a pictures it takes about 2 seconds to process which gets irritating because sometimes an object is moving and you might miss it because the camera is slow. Again if you are used to the iPhone camera but looking for something like that quality but in a digital camera this is not the one for you.

I have used it on many occasions and for general picture taking it gives high quality and high pixel photos. It is in now standard form where the rear screen is used to select the picture. The camera has a flash and the focusing has a reasonable range.,However there are some things worth noting:,1. I cannot get good macro close ups of flowers. The combination of a poor macro and the rear image have yielded several out of focus pictures.,2. There is a significant time lag between taking pictures, 5 to 7 seconds before you can snap another. I do not know why this is the case so if you are trying to snap some fast motion pics this may not be for you.,Overall it fits neatly in a pocket and unless you rely solely upon you smart phone this is a well priced option for quality pictures in general.","August 31, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,Dr. Terrence McGarty

Stabilization, Touch Enabled 3-Inch LCD, Wi-Fi, DC-FZ80K (Black)","Although I have had this camera for only a few weeks, I must say the FZ70 is one of the best values in digital camera. From here, all references to lens focal length will be in 35 mm film photography equivalent.,For about $300, you get a 60X lens that stretches from a heretofore unheard of 20 mm ultra wide to 1200 mm super telephoto, all in a relatively small and light package. Most super zoom cameras have a zoom range of 24X to 50X, and the wide end usually starts at 24 mm or 28 mm. You won't believe how much wider 20 mm is until you compare pictures of the FZ70 with ""lessor"" super zooms taken at the widest setting.,If you shoot video, the microphone's sound gathering capability will adjust with the zoom lens's focal length, so that even when you zoom in, you can get good sound from a distance.,Other than being an excellent value, the FZ70 gives you the ultimate in convenience. There is no need to haul a whole bag of heavy lenses in order to take different shots. The magic is in the size of the image sensor, which is 1/2.3 inch. This is much smaller than sensors in APS-C or Micro Four-Thirds cameras. But also because of its smaller size, it becomes possible to design a super zoom camera with an astonishing zoom range. If you use a full-frame camera, the zoom range is about 3X to 4X at most before the lens physical size, weight, and cost become prohibitive.,So the trade-off is image quality vs. convenience vs. cost. The FZ70 takes, IMHO, excellent pictures and video. It won't do as well in low light situations when compared to cameras with larger sensors, but the pictures and videos are still very good to excellent.,I prefer using the zoom lens on this kind (superzoom/bridge) of camera, because it allows quick AND smooth zooming action using the convenient, powered zoom ring around the shutter release. Most DSLR cameras do not have this feature; you need to twist the zoom lens itself, which cannot be done smoothly throughout its zooming range. This is especially important when shooting video.,If you want to know more about this camera, both before and after purchase, you can download two official FZ70 owner's manuals by googling ""fz70 owner's manual"". The Basic manual is 34 pages long, while the Advanced manual is 226 pages.,For me, I believe that the best camera is one that I can take with me all the time, without straining my neck, shoulder, or wallet.,I highly recommend the Panasonic Lumix FZ70 for convenience and travel photography. While others miss shots contemplating which lens to use and changing lenses, you won't. ;-)","December 14, 2013",5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazonian Consumer

The battery loader photo is accurate. The memory card big chip and memory card small chip are not shown how they fit together. Why is that?? It is the most important load and the lock, or memory lock seems un--necessary. Why have that? Anyway, if you show the picture simply....we will not have to look stupid....asking our friends??

Stabilization, Touch Enabled 3-Inch LCD, Wi-Fi, DC-FZ80K (Black)","The camera is fantastic. I'm not going to repeat what others already wrote, but I wanted to add a few things:,1. Panasonic is using a strange folders naming on the SD card where the video clips are hiding. It reminds me Sony. Never understood why it is needed to have the video clips (which are MTS files and not AVI, MOV or whatever you saw before) buried three levels down in the card.,2. When the camera is turned ON, there is a strange noise that never stops but increases when the lens is extended. If you place your ear above the Mic, you can hear it well... When you switch the mode to Play, the noise goes away. It is there always and only when the camera is in capturing mode... all modes.,3. The Flash shoe, as nice as it may be, does not work with all mountable flashes. I tried the Nikon SB600 and no joy. When I press the shutter button to take a picture, the flash resets and recharges, but there is no flash light... So the shutter causes the short to tell the flash to reset, but not receiving the command to fire it, strange.,4. The lack of a lens hood is an issue, especially when you have a lot of light using the zoom. I found a rubber hood with a 55mm thread outside (that fits to the camera thread) and 55mm inside, so you can attach a filter to protect the lens. Of course, found it here on Amazon.,I've added a few images of a mountain and cactus using the different zoom settings. You can find those images at the Users Gallery above.,Although I have a few minor issues with the camera, I still gave it 5 stars because the number of features that are built into this body and the X60 zoom are just remarkable. I use a DSLR full time and adding this lens in a shape of a camera, as much as there is a difference between the two, is a great way to be more mobile.

Stabilization, Touch Enabled 3-Inch LCD, Wi-Fi, DC-FZ80K (Black)","My sister is not an accomplished photographer at all, but she found this camera at a local camera store and took it on our trip to Tanzania in February. I wanted a super-zoom too and got the Coolpix P530 because we use Nikon's at my office and I was very familiar with the interface. Well, this Lumix definitely outperformed my Coolpix. It has a longer zoom, which I knew ahead of time. I could not get the Coolpix to adjust focus when I shot video and zoomed in and out, there was audible noise on the zooms. And the Lumix has the ability to adjust photos in the camera, which is pretty cool and which we are all getting used to on our smartphones. When I got back, I returned the Coolpix and purchased this Lumix, and have not regretted it a bit. I'm sure I haven't taken it through all of it's bells and whistles, but so far, I'm very pleased with the purchase.","April 28, 2014",5.0 out of 5 stars,Laura Jesberg

The FZ70 has replaced an older Panasonic Lumix model that I've been using for 7 years.  This new one is much quicker boot up, it focuses faster, it is truly spectacular in low light conditions.  As with all digital cameras, it has many functions which I will probably never use, but access to this camera's,adjustments and settings is much easier and more intuitive than the old camera.  In other words, Panasonic has produced a new model that improves greatly on the old model.  I'm glad I bought it.","August 11, 2014",5.0 out of 5 stars,Jerry

Stabilization, Touch Enabled 3-Inch LCD, Wi-Fi, DC-FZ80K (Black)","I've used this camera for quite a while now, so that I could give my honest review.  I'm a professional photographer and I wanted a lighter, smaller camera for certain situations when it's impractical/hard to haul around my DSLR and lenses.  As familiar as I am with digital cameras it took a while to learn all the features and how to get to what I wanted quickly, such as auto bracketing, but I'm becoming faster with experience.  For the most part it's a wonderful camera, and I couldn't be happier with the amazing zoom.  I believe the onboard stabilization works well, and I've gotten some good shots provided the light is good and it's not extended quite fully. I've been happy with the overall sharpness. It's easy to handle and seems to be pretty sturdy. I'm still working with the white balance, as it tends to shoot towards the cyan side, but that can be easily adjusted later in post production.  I also like the macro feature. There are so many features and I'm having fun exploring all of them.,I do have a couple of gripes with the camera, the first of which is the amount of noise. I've read that others don't seem to see it, but I'm dealing with as high a resolution image I can get, and unless the light is optimal where I can shoot with a 100 or 200 iso setting I need to do a lot of post processing. (I could use a tripod, but if I was going to haul that along I'd bring the big camera.)  Low light situations do give you good color and sharpness, though. The other issue, and the most worrysome, is the delay in writing to the card.  There is a limited burst feature that can be somewhat helpful although it only gives you 3 shots.  I'm using a Transcend 32GB SDHC Class 10 card which has proven to be fast in my DSLR, but still quite slow in this camera. This means that it's not as good for some wildlife (or small children and dogs) shots and the like, as if your subject is moving you'll need to wait up to a full second between shots.,These annoyances are balanced with the price and features.  Everything dealing with photography is about compromise. :)  This the most I wanted to spend on this type of camera, and I'm very happy with the return on my money. If I wanted a little more more I would have had pay a lot more.,I've attached a few examples I took yesterday late in the afternoon, when the light was starting to fade. The first one of the tree trunk and grass was taken with iA which exposed with a 3200 iso, which as you can see is very grainy (to be expected with that exposure and conditions).  The second one, of the reeds, was taken with the zoom and aperture priority, with an iso fo 400.  The third one, skyline and blue sky, was also with an almost fully extended lens and iso of 200. These were all shot RW2 and are at 100% resolution.","July 22, 2017",4.0 out of 5 stars,Helen

I'm a near-professional photographer with 40 years' experience using every type of camera imaginable. I also like a bargain. So I bought the Panasonic. Even though it was refurbished, it arrived without a scratch and in perfect condition. It's an amazing camera; does everything; has all the bells and whistles; the viewfinder is essential for any ultra-zoom camera. Most importantly, it's so sophisticated that you just point and shoot your way to photos that will impress everybody. No fuss. No mistakes. Get this camera.

Stabilization, Touch Enabled 3-Inch LCD, Wi-Fi, DC-FZ80K (Black)","I think many people including me bought this camera because of its 60X zoom.  The zoom is remarkable, but after you use the camera for a while you find out some wonderful things that are not really talked about.,First, the camera does a remarkable job recognizing back lite scenes and compensates remarkably well.  If for example you open the flash and there is a bright window behind the person whose picture you are taking it compensates perfectly.  Often it can compensate for back lite without the flash, but it will remind you when back light requires flash.,Second, with flash skin tones are remarkable.  Also, most flashes on little cameras wash out at close range this one doesn't.  It also compensates so that you don't find people up close are overexposed while everything in the background goes dark.  Obviously this only works up to a point.,I always shoot with the the red label (iA). you have nothing to lose and much to gain. This provides a modest HDA exposure that doesn't scream ""manipulation"" and also, I believe, provides some sharpening.,Even with a sturdy tripod it is just about impossible to keep the camera steady while pushing the shutter button at 60X.  So use time delay with your tripod on long shots.,Robert I. Rhodes","April 20, 2014",5.0 out of 5 stars,retired professor

Stabilization, Touch Enabled 3-Inch LCD, Wi-Fi, DC-FZ80K (Black)","I gave it 5 stars in reference to the price. While you'll never mistake the photos taken by this for photos from a nice dslr, for the money this camera performs really well. The balance is a little strange since the majority of the weight is the excellent zoom, but is comfortable enough in the hand for the average application. High speed shooting is definitely not a strength; it's not recommended for birding unless you're comfortable being very persistent and are prepared to shoot A LOT, which is unacceptable to most birders. Indoor shooting is okay in most lighting conditions, though it struggles in low light. The flash is powerful for a pop-up, as with all cameras the learning curve for indoor shots is a bit steeper. I may sound a bit negative, but overall I really like the performance vs. price. For the average user, I highly recommend this product.","May 7, 2014",5.0 out of 5 stars,J. Koyen

The controls are not as easy as the Pentax that I returned before buying this, but the picture quality is better the zoom lens is astonishing! The only drawback is the manual. The one provided with the camera is scant on information, enough to get the owner up and running,but not much else. I needed more detail. A manual comes on the cd to be downloaded and then printed if desired, however, I could not get it to print. I wound up ordering the manual from a third party, so now I have the manual that should have come with the camera in the first place. Who in the world is going to carry a computer around all over the place so that he or she can refer to it while getting accustomed to the camera. Not me, that is for sure.

There was NO authenic 32 Memory Card in the box. I suggest you check random boxes/kits to see if there are any more like mine. This leaves me with NO Memory Card.

Stabilization, Touch Enabled 3-Inch LCD, Wi-Fi, DC-FZ80K (Black)","This is my third lumix. These products perform. I had a much older version of this one which I loved but let the family borrow it to go whale watching. There were several versions of the story but all indications are that the camera hit the deck hard. Never quite worked after that. I use the camera for work so I replaced it quickly with one of the smaller Lumix cameras. It was wonderful and I used it daily for the past 3 years. But I have large hands and yearned for the larger model. This new camera has several advantages over the smaller Lumix's and it's predasesser as well.,The image stabilizer is terrific. I'm a Real Estate Appraiser and I buzz past recently sold houses and listed houses while I snap a picture. My photos come out beautifully. I use many pictures in my appraisal files and require very small picture files - thumbnails really. Well this camera easily adjusts the picture size down, then back to larger files later for family shots. That's the other thing - I also bought this camera to update my video camera. The motion picture button is a great convenience and while I've only used it a couple times so far, it appears to produce great video. I pop up the flash for house interiors and get great results. Sometimes it does this thing where it takes multiple images then combines them into one. Then it makes you wait a sec while it saves that. I'd just assume it just flash since the resulting pics are just ok - so that's one thing. But then I put down the flash and work outside and the camera transitions beautifully.  One last thing - the optical zoom works well.,Some appraisers are using their iPhones and putting the pics right into the file. That's pretty kool and I get that. But using a real camera still gets a way better result than a phone. I'm sticking with my Lumix.","June 28, 2014",5.0 out of 5 stars,Terry

It takes really good pictures and video outside with sunshine but takes very poor pictures inside unless there is a MASSIVE amount of light. The flash is kind of wimpy and objects behind the subject are grainy. The mic picks up even the slightest bit of wind so forget about hearing people talk if the wind is really blowing. It even picks up the breeze from a ceiling fan indoors.The WiFi keeps losing connection with your smartphone and it is a pain in the a** to keep connecting.When you do connect you can only take still pictures remotely but not video.You can't connect to a smart TV or a computer to use it as an on screen camera which really sucks. Will not connect as a web cam either. The zoom is not smooth and effects the sound also .

Stabilization, Touch Enabled 3-Inch LCD, Wi-Fi, DC-FZ80K (Black)","For a light weight digital camera it is good for some events and not so much for others.  I've only had this camera for a month as a backup to my higher end cameras.  From the lower zoom to about the 500 mm zoom the photos are good when shot in RAW (JPG starts to get fuzzy and grainy early in the 30x zoom range and because I take a lot of nature and landscape photos the 500 to 1200 (60x range) the photos quality diminishes. I'm comparing the quality with higher-end DSLR cameras/lens and that might not be fair since this is not promoted as comparable. Close up and objects not more than 100-150 feet the camera is good.  I would not recommend this camera if you are looking for overall great optics and low pixelation (the effect caused by zooming in on a photo making pixels visible). Shooting in the RAW mode does help however it uses up a lot of memory and battery (fewer photos on a memory card and battery drainage).  I've been shooting since the early 1970 (film) and digital higher end DSLR's from the very early 2000's.  I'll keep experimenting to see if I can improve the photo quality to the point I would like it to be... but until then ""It's O.K."" (3 stars) is the best I can give it.","January 10, 2014",3.0 out of 5 stars,William Moore

I am a rank Amateur and don't pretend to KNOW everything about cameras but I do know what I like and don't like., That said...  I so wanted a LONG LENS camera but knew the traditional DSLR's were more than I could handle.. too heavy and too many lens to carry ..  so I have been buying bridge cameras but wanted one with a SUPER long LENS.,..  I had bought a Panasonic in the past and was very pleased with it.. since then have bough Canon's,  Fuji's and Samsungs... but  there s something about the FEEL of this camera in my hand that makes me SMILE.. it fits perfectly... Button's are were they are suppose to be and easy to access.. The camera fits into a standard camera case... and not a lot of extra's are needed to make this an amazing tool.,  The onboard menu is easy to understand.. and MAKES SENSE.. it follows logical progression... something I don't often do but other might but it has some great in camera EDITING... options.,  The weight of this camera is nominal.. easy to handle and carry either around you neck or in a sm  camera bag.,As  I previous said it fits my hand well....that is one thing I leaved from buying a variety of cameras from various makers.. If it doesn't feel good in you hand as SOON as you pick it up.. it will never feel comfortable.. no matter what.., ..... One thing the camera does NOT have is wifi access.. I easily solved that with a EYE FI Mobi SD card.. ( works PERFECTLY)...not knowing how well I might like it I go the sm size a 8 gig and .. Honestly that is wonderful.... you can transfer you photos as soon as you take them to a tablet or cell phone..  and NO WI FI SIGNAL IS NEEDED...  but this isn't what your interested in...,.......  The camera has some surprising and easy to use features that I was UNAWARE of when I bought it... I has a very easy to sue Panorama option...... and it has a 3D option to use while taking videos.. ( you can only use this if you view your 3D pictures on a tv w 3 D capabilities ) but it is something I was not aware that it could do..,.......  Videos are NICE... bright and clear and sounds has definitely been improved over my previous Panasonic.,Lots of creative filters to try out  but  you can completely let the camera do all the heavy lifting for picture taking if you don't want to MESS with all those setting.. the auto modes on this camera do a bang up job.,  Honestly... I can't say that I want or NEED anything else on this camera... other than the missing wifi access which I easily solved.. for me this camera is a Perfect Match..,  I got a great MONO pod to use when taking the LONG Telephoto shots...  and a few lens filters.. and I am totally SET,I am delighted with this product and Highly recommend it .,....... Buy one and go out and take some amazing photos .. your friends and family will be Shocked and Delighted, .","July 17, 2014",5.0 out of 5 stars,Mocha's mom

Stabilization, Touch Enabled 3-Inch LCD, Wi-Fi, DC-FZ80K (Black)","I agree with many others that this is one of the best cameras you can get for the money. A great starter camera or even for veteran photographers that are looking for lots of zoom without the cost and weight of DSLRs. For only $250 (at the time of this writing) you get 1200mm range, insanely wide 20mm photos, and a camera that takes above average photos even in fairly low light. It also has allot of nice manual modes to go along with a very smart auto mode. It focuses pretty fast and pictures look good until you get really far into the zoom. Then you either need a good tripod or better lighting to take a really good pic from range. Impressively I was able to follow some aircraft while keeping long range zoom most of the time. Although once you do lose focus, it's hard to find it again.,The main reason I got this camera was not for the picture quality but for the Movie Mode. I like documenting fast moving high altitude aircraft like Contrails and Chemtrails (Yes I said it) and many other interesting things in the sky. Since there seem to be hardly any decent Camcorders with any kind of serious zoom range, I had to look into Photo Cameras. The movies that this camera does take are quite impressive in terms of audio and video for a camera mainly meant for Photography. But one of the reasons I chose this camera other than taking decent photos was for smooth 60 Frames Per Second Video. The claims that this camera can do 60FPS are completely false because after you really dig, you find out the Sensor is limited to 30FPS. So even though the video may be encoded at 60FPS, you only see 30 because the sensor is limited to that frame rate. This is not a big deal to probably 90% of people that buy this camera but some want a dual solution for good photos/video.,I'm now returning to try out the Olympus SP-100 that seems to have similar features as the FZ70 with a little higher price tag. Along with high speed video modes and a better motion tracking system for birds or other fast moving long distance craft. It seems true lifelike 60FPS is very hard to find on superzooms. I will miss the 20mm wide photos that this great camera is capable of.,Again I want to point out that I rated this camera 4 Stars and find it to be on the best values out there for a camera period. It just didn't completely fit my needs of what I expected in a very competitive Superzoom field. For others who don't care about the stuff I mentioned, this is a 5-Star camera in most every way when you consider the price tag.,UPDATE: I tested out the Olympus SP-100 and the Lumix totally destroys it. The noise on the Olympus is terrible and almost unusable in low light. The picture quality is smartphone quality at best. The stablization is poor and does not look like 60FPS either like it claims. ARRGH. Guess I'll have to be satisfied with the Lumix as there is not much in the way of high framerate video for superzooms.","August 2, 2015",4.0 out of 5 stars,Jeremy

(My DMC-5 is ultra fast, and it is by no means a high-end camera.),If you are using the (very cool) high-zoom feature to capture a distant shorebird or diminutive warbler, this camera will ""hunt"" for several seconds trying to get it into focus.  And, as you know, that's all it takes for the bird to be gone.  And forget trying to capture a bird in flight against the sky as a background!  It simply will not focus.,Also, it is also slow in writing to the SD card.  This makes it very hard to take a quick burst of shots of a moving bird.,One last thing.  I am a man with a large hand, and find this camera too bulky for ease of control manipulation.  Many people would find the camera to be too large.","July 26, 2017",3.0 out of 5 stars,H. B.

I've owned this camera's bigger buddy the Panasonic GH4 for a few years and am used to the controls and the camera's firmware.  Panasonic does a great job with their auto-focus implementation as well as the camera's software, particularly the touchscreen implementation.,For such a tiny sensor comparatively to the GH4 (and even other mirrorless cameras my Sony A7R2), it does a good job.  If you pixel peep at the images, they're definitely not going to be the same quality as a $3K camera and $1k lens combination for a pro-level mirrorless or DSLR.  But, those same pro cameras cannot touch the zoom range of this camera.  If there's enough light, the pictures and video from this camera as outstanding, given the camera's sensor's limitations.  The stabilization is also fantastic.  You can hand-hold a lot of shots and video that would never turn out with a camera+lens without stabilization.,Pros:,* Unbelievable zoom range,* Good quality photos and video with enough light,* Stabilization is fantastic,* Panasonic's camera firmware, menus and touchscreen implementation are top-notch,* Great battery life, cheap after-market batteries as well.  I recommend these batteries and charger: ,* Fantastic remote control and live view of the camera from a smartphone or tablet.  Panasonic's remote control and live view implementation is hands-down the best among all the camera vendors.,Cons:,* Low light or fast-action shots without a lot of light are challenging,* Zoom mechanism is a little rough and not smooth (likely because the lens is so light but the zoom range is so unbelievably long),Highly recommended camera for general purpose walk-around shots.","August 19, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,H.

B019UDHT6U,Canon-PowerShot-Digital-Camera-Stabilization,Canon PowerShot ELPH 180 Digital Camera w/Image Stabilization and Smart AUTO Mode (Red),"My last Canon I had was a Powershot SD1100IS that I had since 2008. I definitely  thought it was time for an upgrade. I really wanted the ELPH 190, but the 180  fit me, budget-wise. I was a bit irked that it didnt come in more colors so I went with silver. When it arrived I noticed the box was much smaller than my last Canon. I opened it and realized this one doesn't come with a CD or USB cable. The disc, I dont mind, but why no cable? Also, it was VERY frustrating and difficult to attach the wrist strap to the camera!! It is made weird and the instructions were no help. (Had to go online and download the instructions - the booklet that came with tells you to do so.) I had to use Super Floss to string it through since dental floss wasn't pliable enough and a toothpick was too hard. Camera also looks cheap and very lightweight. Battery is also hard to insert and remove! It does take good pics from what I can tell. The zoom feature is great and takes clear zoom photos even from far away. If it wasn't for the fact that I need a camera for an event this week, I would return it right away and go with something else. Anyway, I don't recommend this camera.  It's much better ones that also takes great pics, but much easier and less frustrating.","June 7, 2017",2.0 out of 5 stars,y.w.

I am visiting my retired Mechanical Engineer son in a different state in October and he thinks he can get in.  If he can't get it in, it is hopeless.

Horrible quality, very cheap made, can't focus and have to turn off and on, so it starts to focus properly again. Unbelievable low quality for Canon, coudn't imagine that Power Shot could be such a bad camera. I had a few Power Shot cameras starting from 2005 and this particular one is be aware. Absolutely waste of money, the camera makes even specific clicking and clacking noise then is trying to focus on a subject. Again, from 11 years of using Power Shot the biggest disappointment.

No eyepiece.  In general daylight, with 50+ year old eyesight, this ... isn't good.  The screen resolution may be great, but basic daylight will give you no idea what the camera is actually seeing, light, polarizing, focus- wise.  I LOVE my SX50HS and thought, this is smaller, has wifi etc - how can I lose?  Let me tell you - you do.  I almost simply returned it - but have decided to just use it as an inside function camera. Set it on auto,  let the kids use it at parties and you get great photos.","November 26, 2017",2.0 out of 5 stars,CindyG

The interface is very intuitive, so you can learn and grow into it as you go along. I've had it for several months now and it is a pleasure. Really like the handle, so you can really get a grip on it while shooting. (A left handed alternative might be a good idea.) The lens zooms into subjects nicely as needed. Only downside is the manual lens cover. Grew spoiled by auto-retracting lens covers over the years.

The LCD isn't as crisp looking as the actual Pictures and Videos really are and the Function/MENU settings are a bit cumbersome to learn (i.e. When/where they can be used as well as learning what options are available when using them).,GETTING STARTED:,Before buying this camera I would suggest that you download the User Manual to familiarize yourself with the Features and Functions of this camera. Also, this camera doesn't come with a SD card, nor does it have internal memory to store your pictures and videos, so you will need to purchase one before you are able to use this camera.,The first thing you will need to do is charge the battery using the included charger. Make sure to line up the Triangles when inserting the battery into the charger base and then plug it in to a power source (depending on which charger you have, USB or wall, will dictate your power source).,While the battery is charging, take a moment and insert your SD Card. Make sure to insert it correctly so as not to damage your memory card or camera - the metal contacts should face the front of the camera as you insert it.,I will not be going through every Feature and Function of the camera as it would be too in-depth to do so. However, you should be familiar with the Function Button on the back of the camera (It's the round dial on the back of the camera about in the middle on the right side). Here is a quick overview:,* Green AUTO Button - Changes between AUTO and Programming (P) modes and is the UP Button,* Gray INFO Button - Turns on and off the Information displayed on the LCD screen and is the DOWN Button,* Lightning Bolt Icon Button - Changes the Flash modes and is the RIGHT Button,* Person Icon Button - Turns on the Auto Focus Feature and is the LEFT Button,* Func. Set (Center) Button - Accesses the Function Menu and is the SET (OK) Button,NOTE: The Power Button is the Small Round Button on the Top of the Camera, The Shutter Button is the Large Round Button on Top of the Camera, The Zoom Lever is the Lever around the Shutter Button, The Playback Button is Button with the Green Play Icon just to the upper right of the LCD screen on the back of the Camera, The Record Button is the Button with the Red Dot just to the right of the Playback Button, The Delete Button is the Button with the Trash Can Icon just to the lower right of the LCD screen on the back of the Camera, and finally... The MENU Button (Self explanatory) is just to the right of the Delete Button. Watch the Video for the location of these Buttons.,After the battery is completely charged (the Amber Light will turn Green), insert the battery into the camera by aligning the Triangle Icon on the battery with the Battery Holder Tab then pull the Tab back towards the front of the camera and insert the battery until it locks into place.,Now that your camera is ready to use, let's get started learning how to use it.,If this is the first time you are powering on your camera you will notice that there is an option to set the Date, Time and Daylight Savings Time. You do not have to do this for the camera to operate correctly. It is used to store EXIF data pertaining to your pictures and videos that you take as well as Date Stamp them. If you do not know what EXIF data is, please look it up so that you may understand the security issues that could be of concern to you.,SETTING THE DATE:,You will need to use the Function Dial to set, or change, the Date and Time. Use the Up/Down Buttons to specify the current Date then use the Right/Left Buttons to move to the next option. Again, use the Up/Down Buttons to set the current time. If you are satisfied with how everything looks, you can press the Func. Set Button to advance to the next option or you can change the way the Date is displayed and select Daylight Savings Time. When you are satisfied with your settings, press the Func. Set Button to proceed to the next option.,On the next menu you will be able to change, or select, you current Time Zone. Use the Right/Left Buttons to select your Time Zone and press Func. Set to complete the process.,You can skip the above settings, but every time you power on your camera you will have to press Func. Set to skip the process. Note: You can change/set the above options at any time by pressing the MENU Button. Here's how:,* Press the MENU button,* Move the Zoom Lever or the Right/Left Buttons to highlight the Tools Icon,* Use the Up/Down Buttons to move through the settings until you highlight the Date/Time... option,* Press the Func. Set Button and then use the Up/Down & Right/Left Buttons to adjust your new settings.,* Press the Func. Set Button to complete the process,SETTING YOUR LANGUAGE:,If you are still in the Tools Menu, simply move to the Language option in the menu - it is the next to last option listed - otherwise proceed as follows:,* Press the MENU Button and move to the Tools Icon,* Use the Up/Down Buttons to move to the Language option in the menu and press Func. Set,* Use the Up/Down & Right/Left Buttons to navigate to your desired Language and press Func. Set,* Press the MENU Button to exit the menu - NOTE: Use the MENU Button any time you wish to exit ANY menu you are in.,TAKING YOUR FIRST PICTURE:,* Power on the Camera (As you power on the Camera look at the upper right hand side of the LCD display and note if ""P"" or ""AUTO"" is displayed - If AUTO is displayed then skip the next step),* Press the Green AUTO Button to select AUTO Mode (The AUTO Mode simply tries to set the Camera to the best options respective to your immediate environment),* Use the Zoom Lever to adjust your desired Zoom level,* Press & Hold the Shutter Button 1/2 way down to allow the Camera to automatically Focus and adjust the appropriate settings for your picture,* Press the Shutter Button fully to take your picture,NOTE: Please observe the LCD screen when holding the Shutter Button 1/2 way down for warning information regarding settings that may need some attention. Also, while in AUTO Mode your setting options will be limited. In Programming (P) Mode, you will have full control of all your Camera setting options that it is capable of using. Again, I will not be going through these two (2) modes as they are very in-depth.,TO VIEW YOUR PICTURE(S):,* Press the Green Play Button to enter Playback Mode,* Use the Right/Left Buttons to Scroll through your pictures for viewing - NOTE: You can press the Func. Set Button for more options during picture viewing.,RECORDING YOUR FIRST VIDEO:,* Select AUTO or Programming (P) Mode, as previously mentioned, then press the Func. Set or MENU Buttons to set any options for recording your video,* Press the Red Record Button (See above if you've forgotten where it is),* Use the Zoom Lever for Wide/Telephoto zoom level,* Press the Red Record Button again to stop recording - NOTE: During recording, the Lens movement (noise) while zooming In/Out will be recorded. Preset your zoom level to prevent this if it is an issue with you.,PLAYBACK YOUR VIDEOS:,* Press the Green Play Button,* Use the Right/Left Buttons to find the Video you wish to view,* Press the Func. Set Button (Play Movie will be displayed in the Function Menu),* Press the Func. Set Button again to play the Video,* Use the Up/Down Buttons to control the volume during playback,NOTE: To exit Playback Mode for both Pictures and Videos, press the Shutter Button to exit out to the Camera LCD screen (Ready Mode).,DELETING PICTURES AND VIDEOS:,* Press the Green Play Button to enter Playback Mode,* Use the Right/Left Buttons to find the Picture/Video you wish to delete,* Press the Trash Can Button,* Use the Right Button to highlight ERASE,* Press Func. Set Button and follow the prompts,NOTE: To erase multiple Pictures/Videos do the following:,* Press the Green Play Button to enter Playback Mode,* Press the MENU Button,* Use the Down Button to highlight ERASE...,* Press the Func. Set Button,* Use the Down Button to highlight one of the following options:, - SELECT - Allows you to pick the Picture(s)/Video(s) you want to erase (Use the Func. Set Button to select them then press the MENU Button and follow the prompts) NOTE: Use the Right/Left Buttons to move through the Images., - SELECT RANGE - Allows you to select a range of Pictures/Videos to erase, - ERASE ALL - This will erase EVERYTHING on your SD Card that is unprotected (This is the same for the above two (2) options),WARNING: Please pay attention and follow the prompts to avoid deleting files that are unprotected - you can not get them back. If you want to protect your Pictures/Video, please do the following:,* Enter Playback Mode by pressing the Green Play Button,* Press the MENU Button,* Use the Down Button to highlight Protect...,* Press the Func. Set Button and follow the prompts,OK folks... That's the Canon PowerShot ELPH in an nutshell. I've uploaded a short video showing the location of the above mentioned Buttons.,[...]","February 22, 2017",4.0 out of 5 stars,Ozarks Airgunner

B019UDHT6U,Canon-PowerShot-Digital-Camera-Stabilization,Canon PowerShot ELPH 180 Digital Camera w/Image Stabilization and Smart AUTO Mode (Red),"While this camera is cheap and has a reliable brand name. It is like the base model camera where even the steering wheel has been made optional. There are several issues with it:,1. Camera just won't focus. It is also near impossible to take picture of a picture because it won't focus.,2. Cannot take panoramic photos,3. Cannot turn-off eye redness check which results in 'too much light' on close objects.,4. Flash can be either turned off or made to go automatic. But it cannot be set to always ON. So you cannot take clear picture inside of a house if your camera does not think that it is dark enough to require flash.","April 21, 2017",3.0 out of 5 stars,Eric Cotton

I received the camera and its neat packaging. Its exactly the same look wise as well as feature wise as my old camera. But the new camera is far worse quality wise. The Sony W800 cannot take a good picture even with the stabilization feature. It blurs on the slightest movement and everything is quite grainy. The same is even worse for my videos. The camera is always out of focus at the most inopportune times and is grainy in the background on top of that. My old Sony was handier, shot perfect pictures, and guzzled down quality videos while being shot at, rained on, and sunned out. Not buying with Sony again.

The picture quality is pretty good, I thought it would be better considering it is 20 MP.  I haven't had the camera long but can't seem to find settings to adjust lighting and outdoor back light. Also, the camera is so small, which is great for carrying around, I find that when I push the button I move/push the camera down causing a slight movement in the camera.  It almost feels like a toy.

My old Kodak shot videos that sometimes turned out almost completely black on the computer, even when I could see just fine in real life while recording. This camera takes videos that look just as bright on the screen as the room does in real life. I was told I couldn't get such a camera for a low price, so that was a nice surprise. They're a little grainy when you transfer them, and quiet for some reason so I have to speak more loudly then usual in them, but still better quality than my old camera's videos were. I'm very pleased with that.,The menu is easy to navigate and I was able to get the hang of it and figure everything out quickly without even referring to the manual - which, by the way, contains information about battery life and how long it takes to charge; another nice surprise.

B00I8BIC9E,Sony-DSCW800-Digital-Camera-Silver,Sony (DSCW800) 20.1 MP Digital Camera (Silver),"I have no idea how such a lousy camera has such rave reviews. I bought this as a Christmas present for my mother and she was so excited when she opened it up. By Christmas dinner, she was taking pictures of everything and everyone. I soon realized she was taking pictures 6 or 7 times over each time because there is a HUGE delay between the time the button is pressed and the photo is taken. Every single photo, someone was either blinking or just looked exhausted from smiling for too long. My mom said she could make due with the delay.,Upon closer examination of the pictures she took, I noticed everyone's skin came out looking nearly snow white, which I can't begin to understand because my entire family is of a mixed African descent.,After barely making it through christmas, we took the camera to a New Years Eve wedding ceremony, where my mother was introduced as her godson's mother because his mother doesn't live in Anerica. She asked me to take pictures of them walking down the isle together. I kid you not, we did not get ONE useable photo out of 101 shots. I used automatic, night mode, and party mode, and every single shot came out dark. I couldn't even distinguish my mother from my cousin, even though my mom was wearing a bright purple dress.,Finally, the charger for this camera is approximately one foot in length AT MOST. To give you some perspective on that, a typical iPhone charger is about three feet long. In other words, you have to leave the camera on the floor while charging or on a chair because a one foot cord is incapable of reaching a table of average height.,Overall, I'm actually extremely embarrassed that I purchased this camera for my mom. I offered to return this one and buy her a new one, but she said i shouldn't because ""I can't afford it."" Essentially, this is a nice way of saying that I clearly bought this camera on an extremely tight budget. I sincerely regret this purchase aside from my moms initial excitement from receiving it.","January 1, 2015",2.0 out of 5 stars,ShoppinOnAmazon

I did my research before I bought my first long zoom camera.  I have had Nikon, Canon, Fuji. All are well made and do what you would expect. But this Lumix FZ70 is over the top good. I have not even tried all the features yet. Basically I set it to auto everything and I'm just loving the images I'm getting. Will be taking it on our Europe trip later on this summer. Just a quick example: Last week during the full ""blood moon"" we had a great view of it here in California. I put the camera on a tripod, set the zoom to 100x and waited. When it went into full eclipse I touched the shutter button. Because of the low light it automatically took a series of 7 or 8 shots. I could hear it during the process. The aggregated image was spectacular. The blood moon effect was awesome. I put it up on FB and received many kudos for the shot. I'm very pleased with my purchase. Way to go Panasonic.

B00I8BIBCW,Sony-DSCW800-Digital-Camera-Black,Sony DSCW800/B 20.1 MP Digital Camera (Black),"I'm not sure why this camera is getting such glowing reviews. As a point-and-shoot for daytime vacation photos, this camera is perfectly serviceable. At nighttime, or under any kind of ""challenging"" conditions (such as a concert), the camera is SLOW as molasses to take pictures, and the pictures are often washed out or out of focus. On vacation in Europe I took (no joke) 50+ pictures of the Grand Place in Brussels at night, and NOT ONE came out decently - all were extremely grainy or horribly out of focus, or both. However, pictures I took with my cell phone came out fine (given that it was a 5MP camera on a $79 phone). Also, pictures I took with my GF's *cheaper* Canon P&S looked fine. So it's not entirely me. I also took this camera with me to a recent CHVRCHES concert: despite being less than 30 feet from the stage, the pics I took with this camera are AWFUL - the pics taken with the 8MP camera on my (new) phone look a hundred times better. It's almost as if the firmware is somehow ""off"" on this camera or something. All I know is, this is my fourth digital P&S camera, and this is the worst one BY FAR - even the godawful HP digital camera I owned back in 2002 took better low-light pictures than this camera. Also, the battery latch has a nasty habit of popping open in my pocket, something that's never once happened with the HP and Canon cameras I've owned in the past.","June 28, 2016",2.0 out of 5 stars,J.

We figured that the price was so low due to the improvement in phone cameras.  But this was cheap because it is built rather cheap.  The photo quality was average to poor, and it just feels like a $100 camera that it is.,We don't use it anymore, and either use our phones, or take our Nikon DLSR with us.

Returned the camera to Amazon for credit.  A few days later I was in a Target Store, near the Electronics Section , saw another model 830.  The sales clerk asked if I was interested in the 830.  Related my previous experience—he configured the camera to print date on photos, we tested it to insure it would.

I had a old Cybershot that I loved and this one is not even close to the same quality of that old camera.  This one takes blurry closeup shots.

This one does not have a movie feature.  I would not buy it again and I am looking to replace it for something better at this point.

Only had it for a few days, but am impressed as is my wife who has a Canon 6D with a couple $1000 lenses.  Bought this so we could just take some decent easy everyday shots without lugging around my wife's camera.  What I've observed so far is that the flash is great!  It actually makes pics look better rather than washed out and over exposed.  The zoom is AMAZING.  I get amazing detail and pictures from a hundred yards away.  Took it to the San Diego Zoo and got best pictures ever of multiple animals like I was 5 ft from them.  It also focuses great!  The pics are sharp and crisp.  So far the camera has been pretty intuitive, but I'm going to have to break out the manual for the burst mode.  Can't find it.  Also, not sure how the aperture priority vs the shutter priority works.  Wife tried to explain, but this will take some reading on my part.  I'm below an amateur.  The only real things I have to compare to are two different Nikon point and shoots I tried previously.  The Nikons provided a blurry picture and the zoom didn't focus making it unusable.  If you're looking for near DSLR quality at a good price, size, and weight I definitely recommend this camera.  I'm contemplating buying another one for my wife who really likes it as well.","May 28, 2015",5.0 out of 5 stars,John Michael Koehler II

Terrible camera.  I am a professional who wanted a little pocket camera to take photos of friends at an event. I had low expectations and this camera did not even meet the lowest possible standard.

Definately not the same quality as a DSLR, but that is expected.  A good travel camera.  To get the most out of the camera, you really want to start learning how to use the manual settings.  One note for low light/night time shots, the manual settings only allow a maximum of an 8 second exposure.  Auto allows for longer exposures.","April 23, 2014",4.0 out of 5 stars,steve

Stabilization, Touch Enabled 3-Inch LCD, Wi-Fi, DC-FZ80K (Black)","The reason I gave this 4 stars is that this is a great little camera for those who want to move into the more advanced photography than allowed by the simple point and shoot ones.  It takes wonderfully sharp pictures and has an easy override for the exposure.  It has quite a number of photographical effects that would take large camera bag filled with filers and gadgets to accomplish in a film camera.  The viewfinder is a lot more comfortable in taking pictures than the screen at the back of the camera which is prone the washing out in bright light.  One feature I especially like is the ability to set the view finder so that it is overlaid with a horizontal and vertical lined grid.  This not only helps with composition but also for aligning vertical structures for architectural photography and also keeping the horizon level.  I have nearly the same view screen in two of my three film SLR’s,A minor complaint I have is that the camera lens reverts most wide angle zoom mode when first turned on.  I would prefer it to start with a more normal view of around 3x to 4x zoom.  It has a lens resume option, but that takes it back to the zoom position last used when the camera was turned on.,A not so minor problem is that it takes nearly three hands to plug the mini USB adapter into the camera.  One to hold the black camera, one to hold open the little black access door, and one to insert the little black mini adapter into the black opening of the black camera.  Night vision glasses and a third hand could be very useful.","October 29, 2014",4.0 out of 5 stars,D. Thayer

I loved my FZ60!! the bad thing was it just quit working after 2 years and I have no idea how to get it repaired. This newer model with the extra zoom is very hard to use unless you have a tripod. It does not take shots well with motion and the zoom is very difficult to use for amateurs like myself. I did not see the FZ60 on here for sale anymore but I would buy it again. I am just trying to sell this model to someone in my family and I will purchase something else. I did read the reviews and most people liked it.

Stabilization, Touch Enabled 3-Inch LCD, Wi-Fi, DC-FZ80K (Black)","Owned for a few weeks now. Used almost exclusively for nature photography, ranging from close ups of insects to distance shots of birds.,The FZ70 does many things well: it has a great zoom, the buttons for control of the features are easy to reach, even when your eye is pressed to the viewfinder (after a bit of practice), and has enough stabilization to allow sharp, handheld photos at full optical magnification. The manual focus control isn't nearly as good or as quick as a ring, but will get the job done if your subject will stay still. It's not a macro camera by any means, but I've been happy with butterfly photos taken far enough away to not startle the insect.,That being said, comparing to my partner's Canon SX50, a few limitations have made themselves clear. The first, and most obvious, is the difference in digital zoom. Pushing the magnification beyond the optical limitations, the FZ70's quality deteriorates much, much more rapidly than the Canon. For distant shots of eagles, the Canon still looks crisp while the FZ70 becomes fuzzy. This holds for both for automatic and for various manual settings. The screen and viewfinder also aren't quite up to par, which makes determining perfect focus or reviewing photos a bit more of a challenge.,At the time of this review, the FZ70 is also $100 cheaper than the Canon SX50, which certainly played into my purchasing decision. It is a very good camera, but I wouldn't say it's the best in its class.","June 19, 2014",4.0 out of 5 stars,Kyle

Other sites have horrible user ratings but somehow I went by the ones on this that give it 4/5.

B019UDHT6U,Canon-PowerShot-Digital-Camera-Stabilization,Canon PowerShot ELPH 180 Digital Camera w/Image Stabilization and Smart AUTO Mode (Red),"Warning! No image stabilization! This is my 5th or 6th Canon powershot camera and they all used to have image stabilization, even the entry level cameras. I don't know at what point they took this away from entry level cameras, but this really affects picture quality. Luckily, I was able to get my ancient SD 1200 working again, which takes much better pictures even though it is MUCH older. If you are interested in this, I strongly suggest spending the extra $20 and going up a level, as that one seems to have image stabilization. IS really makes a difference in any indoor or darker environment. I wish I would have paid attention to this detail, but you never previously needed to. Be aware. I'm also bugged that this camera has fewer manual controls than older models of entry level cameras. Is it time to switch brands or start using my phone more?","June 9, 2017",1.0 out of 5 stars,D.

Very humble and simple yet fun camera to use. The kit is even very good. My only complaint is the low battery life. Other than that, this is a great camera with a good super zoom on it. No eye view finder on it so it becomes some what complicated for me when just viewing the LCD screen only when I'm in super zoom mode. But using continuous shot mode I'm able to get clear photos of birds on trees that are a hundred yards away nearly. I'm even able to photograph airplanes flying through the sky but a little tricky to do. Overall a very decent camera with kit at a very affordable price. Fun to use for street photography. Taken photos of the stars, landscapes, models for modeling, animals, and just overall fun family pics. I give it four stars because of low battery life but a additional battery does come with the kit which helps tremendously. Thank you!,P.S.

I only do photography as a personal hobby so I feel it takes nice sharp photos for my purposes. I don’t have to do much editing as Canon takes great quality photos right out of the box.

B019UDHT6U,Canon-PowerShot-Digital-Camera-Stabilization,Canon PowerShot ELPH 180 Digital Camera w/Image Stabilization and Smart AUTO Mode (Red),"I have had only a short while to use this. Takes great photos, but you do have to spend time learning the function mode settings. I feel that the ones offered: tiny camera, monochromatic, pinhole are all effects that you can easily add while editing your photos on the simplest photo editing sites. You cannot quickly add the effect, take a shot, then get rid of the effect. In fact, it is hard do get the camera out of the mode and back to reset. The most useful modes are macro and fish eye lens. Again, it takes some thumbing around to access those modes. Jury is still out.","April 8, 2016",3.0 out of 5 stars,Leafpeeper

B019UDHT6U,Canon-PowerShot-Digital-Camera-Stabilization,Canon PowerShot ELPH 180 Digital Camera w/Image Stabilization and Smart AUTO Mode (Red),"I cannot stand this camera. I have had two Canon Powershot's before and loved them.  My last one just broke so I decided to buy this one before we went to Disney Land so some days I wouldn't have to lug my big Nikon DSLR around with me.  This model was a huge let down.  It had a slow response time, so when the camera finally did fire the people had already walked out of the frame. It wouldn't shoot rapid fire for mulitple frames and it had very poor low light capabilities.  I finally just gave up using it and got better results with my iphone by far.  I'm very disappointed.,Sadly I missed the return window so it looks like 5yr old and 9yr old will be getting to play with this camera.","May 12, 2016",1.0 out of 5 stars,Sarah

B019UDHT6U,Canon-PowerShot-Digital-Camera-Stabilization,Canon PowerShot ELPH 180 Digital Camera w/Image Stabilization and Smart AUTO Mode (Red),"Although a negative review I'm not here to just complain but hopefully help others make a decision. I'm not a pro wedding photographer, but I am an experienced photographer who has owned a variety of cameras over the years and I take the time to read features and instructions for each camera to get the best result. I picked this camera up a year ago for its small size, high MP and brand name. The amount of time it takes this camera to focus is simply disastrous. I have used numerous settings to take photos of sporting events, subject up close and far away. Blurry every time. If you are taking still shots in excellent natural light, you can get a decent photo. Under other lighting conditions, terrible! Night or low light? forget it, nothing comes out clear. Sports or moving objects - 1 out of a thousand will come out clean. Fact is I purchased this camera to get better pictures than my phone, turns out the phone easily beats this cheap toy from Canon. Again, i'm not a shaky handed novice photographer so trust me when I tell you, don't purchase this camera, go up to a higher level camera or stick to using your phone. Sony Cybershot cameras in the $150-$200 range have delivered the highest value to me over the years, this is what I'm going back to for a simple Point and Shoot.","February 15, 2018",2.0 out of 5 stars,Gerald A.

It does not allow lens to be changed but it has a very wide range for zooming.  In fact the tele is so long that one must use a tripod unless it is in the brightest of light.  The zoom feature is on a toggle switch and not like SLR which would be on the lens.  Therefore, it is a little slower to change focal length.  The glass monitor is pretty large and bright.  The pictures are sharp as you should expect.  I am no connoisseur, just a hobbyist so I cannot give you a very sophisticated review on the optics.  Be aware that this camera, unlike many Lumix camera, does not carry the Leica lens designation.  On the other hand, that really isn't that important these days, from what I hear.

B019UDHT6U,Canon-PowerShot-Digital-Camera-Stabilization,Canon PowerShot ELPH 180 Digital Camera w/Image Stabilization and Smart AUTO Mode (Red),"I have had this camera for a little over two weeks now and I can honestly say that is it a great camera if you are on a budget. With 20 mega-pixels this camera takes extremely clear pictures and amazing video (at 720p HD). The small design of this camera is great for taking trips and just placing it in your pocket.,BATTERY LIFE:,For the short amount of time I have had this camera, I cannot say too much about the battery life. I charged the battery when I first purchased the camera and have not had to recharge it since. Being a YouTuber, I shoot a lot of video and have used this camera on average 2.5 to 3 hours each day since I purchased it. I also take a lot of pictures with this camera (I have a dog who likes to sleep or sit in very odd positions), but again, I have not had to recharge since the first time.,20 MEGA-PIXEL & 8X OPTICAL ZOOM:,As stated previously I take a lot of pictures, and with the 20 mega-pixels this camera provides the pictures come out very clear and almost perfect. I say almost perfect because while it does take clear pictures the Smart AUTO feature does cause some problems if you are not taking pictures in idealistic settings.,With the 8x optical zoom I have noticed is not as good as other point and shoot cameras. Again this will depend on if you are shooting in idealistic settings, but on this camera it unfortunately does make the photo a little pixelated if you are trying to zoom in. Having taken a variety of pictures with the camera I have to say that unless you are shooting with extremely good lighting, the zoom on this camera should not be used past half of the full feature.,SMART AUTO:,Smart AUTO is honestly a great feature on this camera because you do not have to program your camera for every situation. The Smart AUTO feature does use 32 predefined shooting situations to determine the best settings for that specific shot, however, it does have its problems. The main issue with the Smart AUTO feature is that if you are taking pictures in less that ideal situations, the camera might choose settings that basically ruin the picture. For instance, when taking a picture of my dog at a dusk setting out in my backyard, the Smart AUTO feature chose the settings of an indoor close up shot. So while this is a great feature be prepared to run into some issues.,CONCLUSION:,While this camera does have a few flaws I do honestly believe it is an amazing point and shoot camera. All of the features do take some getting used to just like any other product out there. I would highly recommend this camera to anyone who has a budget they need to stick with but still wants a great camera for either pictures or video.","November 21, 2017",4.0 out of 5 stars,Joseph

The wrist strap comes separately and is extremely difficult to attach. I was unable to do it. A previous camera in this line came WITH the wrist strap attached. Why not this one? The enclosed info booklet had such small print I needed magnifying eyeglasses PLUS a large magnifying glass to read it. And then it had little info of value other than FCC rules. To find operating instructions, I had to go to the Canon website where I had to download a manual that previously came with the camera. The manual was a staggering 216 pages!

When I take photos I usually take the card out and put it in the computer, but I will not be able to do that any more. Instead I will have to use a mini USB cord. Yes, it is that flimsy.","August 20, 2017",3.0 out of 5 stars,tmtrvlr
B019UDHT6U,Canon-PowerShot-Digital-Camera-Stabilization,Canon PowerShot ELPH 180 Digital Camera w/Image Stabilization and Smart AUTO Mode (Red),"I am so disappointed in this camera. I have always been a Canon girl and was looking for a replacement of the camera that I keep in my purse, my previous camera had reached a point to where the lens cover was not closing all the way, but it was several years old. With the new camera most of my shots are blurry or have a glare in them. So disappointed.","June 22, 2017",1.0 out of 5 stars,Karen L
B019UDHT6U,Canon-PowerShot-Digital-Camera-Stabilization,Canon PowerShot ELPH 180 Digital Camera w/Image Stabilization and Smart AUTO Mode (Red),"Poor quality photos.  After 5-10 photos it stops focusing properly even in daylight and in high contrast scenes.  After ruining many photos of events important to me, I finally learned that I have to turn it off occasionally so it can reset itself.  It would be nice if there was a firmware update to fix that.  Most lower-light photos are unacceptably grainy and out of focus because the camera seems to default to increasing ISO rather than operating the flash.  I think I have defeated that feature by finding the menu selection to force the ISO to 100 or 200 rather than letting the camera set it.  Even when operating at what I think is its best, colors seem dull.  I tried setting the colors to ""vivid"" and they turned out unnatural and with an orange cast.  Still experimenting with settings, but so far this is a big disappointment compared to my previous Canon pocket camera.","September 15, 2017",2.0 out of 5 stars,drm_sandiego
B019UDHT6U,Canon-PowerShot-Digital-Camera-Stabilization,Canon PowerShot ELPH 180 Digital Camera w/Image Stabilization and Smart AUTO Mode (Red),"I bought an Elph 180 in August and took it straightaway on a major PCT SecJ backpacking trip (7 days). It was by far the lightest, most compact camera available at short notice, and I had had the previous model (2016) - and killed it using it in rain (photos recovered from SD Card)!!,Online reviews had dissed the Elph 180 battery life as limited to 220 per charge, so I started out rationing the number of photos I took daily, and with flash disabled.  However 5-6 days into the trip, the battery was still reading FULL, and I had taken over 150 mountain,  views, flower shots etc, so I let loose.,Total of 220 shots later (coincidence) it still read full and we reached civilization, with a bunch of GREAT photos - only issue was the wildfire smoke limiting the visuals.,I love this camera - but will now always keep it in a ziploc baggie on wet days.,Let's fix global warming!!!","September 2, 2018",5.0 out of 5 stars,Richard Menzies

I do, however, expect that it will take a decent picture.  I tested out the camera inside, outside, daylight, and in low light.  Each picture, no matter when taken or in what setting, failed to come up sharp.  With a Zeiss lens and at 20 mp, this camera underperforms my old Elph which cost $145, had a metal body, and took clear pictures all at 8mp.  Truly underwhelming, on top of adding a plastic body to the camera, giving it a cheap feel.,On the whole, a grand disappointment.","December 8, 2015",2.0 out of 5 stars,outwest

B00HNJWUBI,Sony-DSCW830-Digital-Camera-2-7-Inch,Sony DSCW830 20.1 MP Digital Camera with 2.7-Inch LCD (Silver),"Bought this as an upgrade for my Sony W330 (which is an outstanding camera). I do not notice any significant improvements; so no ""wow"".  The macro focus and the low light sensitivy appear to be comparable to the W330; these are 2 of its best features. The panorama feature is a little disappointing as it only captures appx 60 degrees and often ends up with misalignments between frames. I have much better luck using an SLR and photostitching software to create superior 360 degree views. At max resolution, the time interval between frames seems really long due to the size of the files. I considered reducing the resolution, but then what's the point - - might was well just use my W330. Still if you're looking for a very compact and very versitile point-and-shoot, I do recommend the W830.","August 27, 2014",5.0 out of 5 stars,tenebboy

I was considering purchasing FZ200 but couldn't justify the cost and FZ70 is 60x zoom vs FZ200 which is only 24x zoom.,I am disappointed though that FZ70 doesn't have capability and or plug in for external remote, although the zoom is excellent and you can get close enough to actually see the surface of the moon and or zoom in distant object or birds as they were at your hand reach. It is rather very difficult to remain steady and prevent shaking as the shake of your hand also multiplies 70 times. It is almost impossible to achieve zooming distant object without a tripod that is, if you want clear picture or movie without distortion but this isn't a camera's fault.,This camera can't be compared to DSLR's but rather is a good bargain in a bridge camera. There isn't enough right up or videos about this camera but I literally watched every video by Graham Houghton on YouTube about FZ200 and that helped me to decide purchasing FZ70 as the features and functions are nearly identical in these two cameras.","July 20, 2014",5.0 out of 5 stars,Altaf

B00I8BIC9E,Sony-DSCW800-Digital-Camera-Silver,Sony (DSCW800) 20.1 MP Digital Camera (Silver),"We were having issues with our DSLR that needed repair and bought this for a holiday trip so we would still get better photos than the smart phone.  Surprised to find out seeing the overall good ratings that this took much worse photos than my wife's very old and outdated smart phone.,Every shot seems blurry and out of focus.  We've had simple Kodak and Canon models in the past (like upwards of 10 yrs ago) that took perfectly clear shots so I do not get what the issue is with this but I see a ton of reviews repeating the issues of blurry photos.  Unfortunately I don't see any suggestions on a fix.,Another thing that I am seeing that is aggravating is the slow response (shutter).  I brought this out again and was messing with it (it is now a toy camera for my 5 year old) and what I had forgotten to mention in my original review is the unbelievable delay from the time you click the button till the eventual flash and exposure.  I would focus click and then by the time the damn thing snaps, your subject has moved or changed positions.  Ever try to take photos of kids?  This reminds me of old pinhole cameras where you have to tell everyone to hold very still for 15 seconds while the film is exposed.","March 30, 2015",1.0 out of 5 stars,R. Smith

B00I8BIBCW,Sony-DSCW800-Digital-Camera-Black,Sony DSCW800/B 20.1 MP Digital Camera (Black),"I bought the Cybershot model DSC-W230 many years ago. It is still going strong, although it developed lens dust/spots, which isn't unheard of for cameras. I bought the DSCW800 because I use these cameras for work, and worried the older one would give up, and wanted to have a replacement before I needed it.,Although this newer model has some advantages, one disadvantage is that the W800 has a difficult time focusing when recording in video mode, something the W230 never has a problem with. It doesn't matter what one is taking a video of, and under what light conditions. It just doesn't want to stay in focus very well. Eventually it will focus, but even if the camera is in a static position, it will go in and out of focus.,It took a long time from order to actually receiving it, which I didn't mind because I really like Sony products, but am disappointed that focusing and staying in focus is really makes it undesirable for taking video. Takes great photos though.","April 4, 2017",3.0 out of 5 stars,CV Rodberg

I opted to upgrade the MP but really do enjoy the brand. As other reviews stated, the zoom crops the photo, if you want something with real zoom, don't buy a point and shoot. If you want a lightweight camera that takes great photos, this would be your best purchase. It's very affordable and performs wonderfully. I photograph my sewn work, you can see the individual fibers in the fabric at the highest resolution, the weaving of the fabric! Very happy.

B019UDI5PO,Canon-PowerShot-Digital-Camera-Optical,Canon PowerShot SX420 Digital Camera w/ 42x Optical Zoom - Wi-Fi & NFC Enabled (Black),"I came to Amazon looking for a camera to take on vacations and trips. I only ever use my iPhone for pictures, and wanted to invest in something slightly more professional that wouldn't break the bank. I am in no way a photographer, but this camera sure makes me feel like one. It's the perfect size for travelers, as it fits in your hand perfectly, as it's very small and portable. I think the picture quality is absolutely stunning. I can zoom into a tree from over 100 feet away and it looks as if I'm right in front of it! I haven't taken this camera on my trip to Europe yet, but will update and post the pictures I take once I do. I've mostly just played around with it, taking pictures of my dog or sister. I included a selfie to show the flash - that was taken in a pitch black room. I wasn't even sure it would come out clear, but wow! Look at the quality!,One thing I would like to address is the wifi, which might be my favorite thing about this camera as a whole. I contemplated buying the Canon powershot SX410, which is a cheaper, slightly older version of this camera, but opted for this because of the wifi feature. I can't boast about it enough. I can take a picture of something, click on the wifi option on the camera, connect to the wifi from my phone, open the free camera app and send the picture directly from my camera to my iPhone. I can also delete that picture from the camera once I've saved it to my phone, so I'll never run out of space! The battery life is also very impressive and it seems to stay charged for a long time (another reason it's great for travelers). And the time it takes to fully charge the battery isn't long at all.,I'm just a person who wanted a cool camera to take nice quality pictures. I'm not a photographer or anything near, but I love clean, crisp quality shots. If you want a small, portable camera that takes AMAZING quality pictures, has a KILLER zoom and flash, and has a wifi feature that allows you to share your pictures on social media in the matter of seconds after taking the picture, this is for you. This camera should be so much more expensive that it is because it's absolutely amazing. 10/10 recommend!","August 2, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,Martha A. Jungenberg
B019UDI5PO,Canon-PowerShot-Digital-Camera-Optical,Canon PowerShot SX420 Digital Camera w/ 42x Optical Zoom - Wi-Fi & NFC Enabled (Black),"I don't have a lot of photography or non-phone camera experience. So, I really just jumped into the DSLR world with this camera. Having this for a week, I really enjoy it for how much it can do.,Seems like a lot of the reviews here are people that don't understand how cameras work (ISO, aperture, shutter speed). You DO NOT have full control over aperture or shutter speed. It's an entry level camera. If you want full control, buy a Rebel T5! The specs are not professional either (they're mid-range at best), so don't expect your quality of pics to be super awesome starting out, you need practice. This camera is a tool, you have to control it. It's not going to take great pics by itself!,Here's a few of my favorite pics I've taken in the past week. Enjoy! :)","August 1, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,J
B019UDI5PO,Canon-PowerShot-Digital-Camera-Optical,Canon PowerShot SX420 Digital Camera w/ 42x Optical Zoom - Wi-Fi & NFC Enabled (Black),"When I first received this camera, I wrote a  review saying I loved it. The photos were super sharp, and the zoom was amazing. It's so easy to use. However, now, a few months after I received it, it suddenly broke. One day, I used it and everything was fine; the next day, for some reason, the zoom lens wouldn't retract and a message popped up telling me to ""restart the camera."" I had not dropped the camera. I kept it in the camera bag, and had no reason to think it had suffered any trauma. I tried multiple times to restart the camera, but it didn't help. I called Canon, and they suggested I send it to them. Instead, I found an authorized Canon dealership nearby. They saw the camera was still under warranty, and took it in for me to send it themselves to Canon. Today, I was informed that Canon will charge me $93.20 to repair the camera because, they say, the lens is not under warranty. The camera store told me that the lens is the most vulnerable part of the camera. Needless to say, I am very disappointed.","July 31, 2017",2.0 out of 5 stars,Grandma Susie
B019UDI5PO,Canon-PowerShot-Digital-Camera-Optical,Canon PowerShot SX420 Digital Camera w/ 42x Optical Zoom - Wi-Fi & NFC Enabled (Black),"The canon power shot sx420 is a neat little “point and shoot” camera. Great focal length (see chameleon and fork pictures) good zoom that stays clear and doesn’t get grainy. This was a gift for some one who thought they might like to get into photography but doesn’t understand terms like iso.,I think this will be a good camera for a beginner as it allows you to change picture resolution, light and focus while looking, but has a feature where it tells you the photos info so you can understand.,Usually a Nikon fan but same price range you can’t get wifi enabled- this has WiFi - and it works well! You need to dig a bit to find the camera functions and not everything is as intuitive as I’d like, but I would say overall very good.,Compact size makes a big difference for this camera. It’s very light and handles well.,Night mode is fairly good- husky photo was low light. You need to figure out the settings with in the mode- but it’s doable.,I took away one star because with everything it DOES do, you should be able to do more outside of the “auto” mode.

B019UDI5PO,Canon-PowerShot-Digital-Camera-Optical,Canon PowerShot SX420 Digital Camera w/ 42x Optical Zoom - Wi-Fi & NFC Enabled (Black),"At first I was thrilled with this camera because the wi-fi features worked right out of the box.,This impressed me. I was quick to review and give it a high rating. I was too quick.,Week after week I started to notice that the shutter speed was too darn slow.,If a subject moves or twitches even the slightest bit, there is a blur.,Canon support, to their credit, is quick to respond, but the suggestions they offer do not work.,There is no setting that seems to impact the shutter speed (even the ISO setting.) It seems the shutter opens for almost a half to 3/4 of a second.,The only pictures that come out decent are ones taken indoors with the flash.,But using bright, available light or exterior bright light yields way too much motion blur.,I bought this camera to show my daughter how a real camera compared to her phone camera.,I lost that argument. Despite the high megapixel feature and big lens... the pictures are really poor. Grainy and blurry.,They other problem is the camera can't focus when fully zoomed in. Maddening.

B019UDI5PO,Canon-PowerShot-Digital-Camera-Optical,Canon PowerShot SX420 Digital Camera w/ 42x Optical Zoom - Wi-Fi & NFC Enabled (Black),"First I bought a Coolpix which had wifi. I never could get the wifi to transfer pics to my iPad and the camera was too small and the controls too close to each other to operate the camera. After I found the Coolpix a new home, I bought this Powershot SX420.,First, the camera is large enough to hold still and to operate the controls. I have arthritis, my hands are a little stiff but I can use this camera without any problem. The thumb rest beside the movie button didn't stop my thumb from sliding, so I put a small square of sticky back Velcro there to use for a thumb grip. Problem solved.,The wifi is very easy set up. Pictures transfer painlessly to my pad or the photo printer.,The long zoom makes the SX420 a great kayaking camera.

It can take very nice photos BUT writing to SD card after a shot is extremely slow. No quick, multiple action shots with this camera., Zoom is great BUT a Tri-pod is recommended to eliminate blur.

Was very easy to set up and takes nice photos. The camera does require a digital card in order to save photos. I purchased one separately from Amazon for 13.00. There is a small strap that comes with the camera. The shutter speed is good but you can not take fast moving shots with this camera. It is better suited for portraits and still life.,The camera is not heavy so would be easy to take with you on a tour. I would also recommend buying a camera bag with the camera to protect it from being scratched or hit. Another nice feature is the Wi-Fi.

B019UDI5PO,Canon-PowerShot-Digital-Camera-Optical,Canon PowerShot SX420 Digital Camera w/ 42x Optical Zoom - Wi-Fi & NFC Enabled (Black),"I am an artist who needed a simple new camera for my colorful artwork (and for personal nature hike photos). I have used the camera for a couple of weeks now (still figuring out some of the settings), but I am super happy with it so far. The color seems good, the zoom works well (though can be a bit grainy on super large shots). I shot the moon photo the second day I had the camera. I am really pleased that the self-timer will remain ON from shot to shot instead of having to re-set every time - very handy! The length of the lens takes a bit of getting used to, but I do like the way this feels in my hand compared to a rectangular point-and-shoot. The largest image resolution is HUGE and will yield crisp prints at a smaller size. I am very glad I ultimately chose this Canon PowerShot SX420 out of the literally dozens of cameras I researched over a month's time! (Photos: I bumped up saturation in post editing on the close up of the 1 "" and 2"" crystals, the moon was shot on a tripod (I never shot the moon before, so that was an exciting result).","March 25, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,Creative Lady

B019UDHT6U,Canon-PowerShot-Digital-Camera-Stabilization,Canon PowerShot ELPH 180 Digital Camera w/Image Stabilization and Smart AUTO Mode (Red),"I *CANNNOT* recommend this camera.  The day after purchasing the Canon PowerShot ELPH 180, I was taking pictures in a museum with family.  Everything was going well and it appeared the camera was pretty good (I left everything on the factory settings).  Every now and then I'd review the pics I took.  Then at one point in the day the camera suddenly gave a 'memory card lock' error and wouldn't take any more pictures.  I was also unable to review any pictures already taken.  I figured maybe it was feature of the camera that once you hit the memory card limit it would 'lock' the card or something.  So I didn't worry as I figured the pictures were still there and I could just transfer them onto my PC or Mac.  When I got home and tried that, both my PC and MAC didn't recognize the SC card.  Nothing.  Zip.  Not only did I lose all of my pictures but the camera fried the SD card to the point that it isn't recognized anymore and can't be reformatted.  I had some IT folks check the card out too thinking maybe I was missing something and they also confirmed, after trying two separate machines, that the SD card was ruined.  The SD card was only three months old and had been working perfectly until used in the camera.  Needless to say, I returned the camera and am very disappointed.  I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS CAMERA and would give it zero stars if I could!","December 11, 2016",1.0 out of 5 stars,Lincolnite

I own 2 other Canon Cameras (Rebel and 7D) so I had faith that this would be an easy, good quality camera. I returned this item after using it for 4 days. I tried it in low light (poor quality, difficult to focus, blurry) and daylight (over-saturated, but not terrible), and shade (difficult to focus, slow). If I were taking photos only of outdoor, well lit subjects, this camera would be fine for someone who wasn't going to edit or resize the photo.  Also, the focus on the camera is not in the center. Even when I was taking a portrait, with the subjects face taking up 70% of the screen, the camera would still chose to focus on the top left or right of the background.

B00I8BIC9E,Sony-DSCW800-Digital-Camera-Silver,Sony (DSCW800) 20.1 MP Digital Camera (Silver),"A nice camera.  Small and maybe a bit too light for steady holding, common to all light cameras.  Long battery run time. Computer I/F & charging cable is non-standard on the camera end - buy a spare cable on Amazon.  A standard SD card will fit. A real photog plus is that the flash exposes for the focus distance, not a general scene exposure which usually results in overexposure on object close to the camera and underexposure on the focus objects.  Another plus is that the battery is held by a latch inside the camera, not by a battery door spring.  I normally set the resolution on 5Mpixels due to uploading to the Internet.  I increase to full resolution when needed.","August 11, 2014",4.0 out of 5 stars,MoldyOldy

I bought it to take pics of the total eclipse of the sun on Aug. 21.  I've been aiming it at the sun - WITH APPROPRIATE FILTER -  and the 1000 mm lens is  tolerably good.  Blue Bonnets in my back yard 75 yards away are very sharp. Haven't been able to shoot the sun yet.  I have used a Canon AE-3 and a pair of 500mm mirror lenses for a number of years and this camera seems equal to them.  It is extremely light weight and very easy to operate.  One thing I dislike intensely about all digital cameras I've seen is a lack of a facility for a cable release.  With a 1000mm lens a cable release seems indispensable. So far that is the only drawback of this camera.,"April 25, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,Little Tex

I find the stabilizer works well and my pictures are sharp - mostly photos of people in casual settings.  After 6 weeks I bought a black one like it for our office and while I think I have set the settings the same I am not sure the pictures are as sharp!  Maybe my eyes have gotten worse (a possibility as I am awaiting surgery) or maybe there is a glitch in the second camera.  The original reviews showed some significant variation from 'clear sharp photos' to 'not happy with clarity of photos'  -- so maybe the black one has some issues as I am same photographer now trying a second one for our office.  Again, I love the red one I got first and stabilization/clarity of photos was one of the main reasons I chose this camera.  I only purchased the second for our office after practicing/testing the first one for 6 weeks.

B019UDI5PO,Canon-PowerShot-Digital-Camera-Optical,Canon PowerShot SX420 Digital Camera w/ 42x Optical Zoom - Wi-Fi & NFC Enabled (Black),"Both pond sample pictures were taken hand-held through a double-pane window about 35 feet from the subjects.  The turkey vulture picture was taken through a double-pane window, hand-held and about 175 feet away.  Those who complain about picture quality are doing something wrong.  I now own two of these cameras--almost instant on so you can capture great shots.  The amazing thing is the equivalent 35mm camera focal length on the lens is 1,000 mm when in pure optical zoom.  Inexpensive, fast, great picture quality and fantastic image stabilization--no tripod needed.  If you're looking for great flash, you're looking at the wrong camera.  I know a thing or three about cameras and photography; simply, you don't need to know anything to take great pictures with these.  You can remove the SD card or hook directly to computer with USB cord.  Apparently Wi-Fi is another feature which I haven't attempted.

Not dumb, stupid, and weak smartphones.,Once you get the camera configured and connected to your Wireless network:,1. You have to press camera wireless button to connect.,2. You start the program on your computer to either import all or copy what you want.,3. You *can not* take pictures while connected to the computer.,4. On the camera now you have to disconnect from wireless, in order to take more pictures.,This is completely unusable, it would be just as easy to take the SD card out of the camera and copy the files, or use a USB cable connected to the camera/computer.,People don't care about cameras, people care about the pictures and copying pictures where they want them.,1. Getting pictures off the camera to a Computer is poor, it works but very inconvenient.,2. The defunct company Eye-Fi had this working better than any company I have found (ten years ago).,3. I never tested the Cloud based upload, nor the smartphone features.,For those of you who have never seen or had an Eye-Fi wireless card: The process of getting pictures to your computer is incredibly simple:,1. Just turn the camera on and shoot pictures, a hundred if you like. The pictures just show up on your computer, without any interaction.,Eye-Fi (now defunct), Originally the software for the eye-fi sucked just like all the rest as it was CLOUD based. But the final software they released (because they shut down their cloud service), was designed to connect to your computer directly using WiFi.,It worked flawlessly.,-Cheers","July 31, 2019",3.0 out of 5 stars,Tymer Top Cat

Stabilization, Touch Enabled 3-Inch LCD, Wi-Fi, DC-FZ80K (Black)","I  had  the FZ47 and have the FZZ00. The FZ47 was a great bargain priced all around camera. The FZ200 has the F/2.8 max aperture lens (from 25mm to 600mm), which makes it a favorite for people who need fast shutter speeds in an affordable package. The FZ70 is, to me, a pumped up FZ47 with double the zoom range. The picture quality is decent and, in good lighting, very good. There is some geometric distortion at full wide angle. If it bothers you, you can correct it in software.  It focuses pretty fast, faster, I think, than the FZ47. Its top burst mode is fast, but shallow - about 3 shots in half a second. In this way, it's much inferior to the FZ200, which fires off shots like a machine gun and goes over 10 shots before pausing briefly to process them. The FZ200 has an articulating LCD scree while the FZ70 doesn't. The EVF is also much sharper in the FZ200.,This is not a camera for someone to take to a night time HS football game under the lights. It simply won't get you a fast enough shutter speed to freeze the action as the max aperture at full zoom is F/5.9. However, it could be useful for soccer moms and dads for daylight games. No part of a football field or soccer pitch would be too far for the sideline fan.  It would also be useful for football and baseball fans who sit far from the field and want to get shots of their favorite coaches or players from high up in the stadium during day games. Other people who might like this camera include real estate agents who can get ""the whole house"" easily at the 20mm setting and amateur enthusiasts taking pictures of large groups at work or school.,Its intelligent auto mode is actually pretty sharp, picking the appropriate mode (portrait, landscape, night time portrait, low light, etc.).,It's not an upgrade from the FZ200. It's an upgrade from the FZ60. However, for less than 400 bucks in the US, I think it's a  good deal.,If you are a photographic perfectionist, a so-called ""pixel peeper"", don't get this camera. Spend the money and get a DSLR with a good lens or two. It will probably cost you well over $1,000. It will not give you the reach you have with this camera.,This camera is like a decent decathlete - it can do lots of things pretty well, but it won't match the ""specialists"" in their strengths.,I like this camera and recommend it. However, if you are happy with ""just"" 25-600mm and can spend $150 to $200 more, consider the FZ200. It's the gold medalist for ""decathlete"" cameras.","September 22, 2013",4.0 out of 5 stars,R.

I wanted a small camera that I could carry at all times, with a descent optical zoom and not pay to much for. Picture quality is great for this size of camera and it is very easy to use.Has some great settings on it to get some cool effects and the video quality is brilliant. I transfer pictures straight to my IPad.Which means I can put pictures straight onto FB or send pictures to friends and family straight away.

She's having a grand time taking photos. We bought an SD card for 10 bucks to store the photos on; I'm not sure the camera would store them without it. Since it isn't marketed for children with a colorful kid-proof body or built-in games (which I really didn't want), it feels like the grown-up item that it is. It's easy enough to operate without reading the manual although some of the butttons are tiny and hard to see without reading glasses. The pictures are clear. I'd even recommend this for an adult who wants a basic camera with few frills.","July 6, 2019",5.0 out of 5 stars,Alex Martinez.

To be fair to the company, shipping was much faster than expected which was great since I purchased this for my impatient 6 year old. However, quality of the product is FAR below the reviews. The camera is very cheaply made and feels like it’ll break in your hands at any moment. There is a switch on the side of the camera that changes between close up and scenic views that feels like it’s going to break the whole camera every time I use it. The camera never focused for any image (I’m experienced with photography and couldn’t get it to focus) and after fully charging the battery for over 15 hours it died after only 3 pictures. I would strongly urge you to reconsider purchasing this product and go with a better known proven point and shoot. For the time being my 12 year old Olympus point and shoot is still a significantly better option for my son and I’m disappointed that I even gave this a try.","July 22, 2019",1.0 out of 5 stars,MMS

B00HNJWUBI,Sony-DSCW830-Digital-Camera-2-7-Inch,Sony DSCW830 20.1 MP Digital Camera with 2.7-Inch LCD (Silver),"This camera was purchased mostly to take pictures of rooms in a house, utilizing as much wide angle as I could get.  For that, it did an acceptable job, although I wish it had an even greater wide angle capability.  Resolution is more than needed, so no problem with that, but the lens was not as crisp and sharp as I had hoped for.  But what can one expect in a low-price point-and-shoot camera?  For top quality pictures, I use other cameras, but I didn't have one with interchangeable lens capability, and could not afford to get what I really wanted.  This camera was an adequate compromise, and will be O.K. for my purpose.","July 7, 2014",3.0 out of 5 stars,a1ac4

B00I8BIBCW,Sony-DSCW800-Digital-Camera-Black,Sony DSCW800/B 20.1 MP Digital Camera (Black),"Easily fits in your shirt pocket. My earlier camera was also Sony, a P200 which was bulkier and heavier. This one is much smarter looking and has a much larger screen and bigger memory capacity for such a small camera. Both take good pics but in low light you want to use the flash to get clear pics. Setting everything on auto including flash is the best option. Easy point and shoot clear pics. But if you are moving around, setting it to 'SteadyShot' may help. A coupla things different from my old camera: the battery remaining time does not show the number of minutes left in each mode. And even when you set the date to 'English' month, it displays the English month only on the screen (i.e., AUG for August) but not on the actual picture's date stamp. This shouldn't be a problem if you don't send pictures to people in other countries where the date format is Day/Month/Year. So if it reads '08 04 2014' they might think it's April 8 instead of August 4. Also, there is no volume adjustment while playing back a movie on the camera. In fact, you won't hear anything at all, regardless of what level you set the volume (the highest level is 4 in Settings). To hear the sound, you plug it into a computer and play the movie.","August 17, 2014",4.0 out of 5 stars,roshanlal

It takes really nice pictures and I'm impressed with all of the features.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it didn't come with detailed instructions for all of the functions.  Just a small brochure to tell you where to put the batteries and a basic illustration of what all the buttons were for.  I had to go to the website and download the instructions, which for me was OK because I have a computer.  What about the people that don't have access to one?  I'm still learning how to use this camera. I bought an SDHC card for it and a set of rechargeable batteries.  The batteries that came with the camera went dead right away.  I must admit that for the price this camera was more than I would have expected.

I bought it only so I could shoot pics of stuff I have to sell on Craigslist or eBay.  Actually, the few pics I've taken have been fine.  Be sure to get a SD card with it.  That's very helpful in transferring photos to PC.  If you were to go to the Kodak website for the  owners manuals you could download that and get a more precise idea of all that is potentially possible with it.  It does use batteries up it seems as some have complained.  But I use rechargeable AA batteries so it's not a big problem if one is not out traveling about.  There are a few settings as well within the menus that allow you to turn off energy using options.  Be sure to do that.  Read the OM though; that ought to answer most of your questions.  I've had no mechanical problems yet but I'm in a relatively stable temperature dust free environment.  I cant' say I'd take it out for touring.  At least not yet.

This is supposed to be a simple point-and-shoot camera, but it is not user friendly out of the box. The first photos I took were awful, blurry, and the flash was wrong. It took forever just to figure out how to override the automatic flash setting which does not work with indoor lighting. I had to look at the user manual online, photography blogs, then play around with the camera to figure out how to adjust the settings. (I had to turn on Blur Reduction and the flash, lower the ISO and adjust the White Balance just to get some decent, usable photos.) It is also difficult to import photos to your laptop. This was a disappointing buy and the return window is brief.","April 16, 2018",2.0 out of 5 stars,8th AF Daughter

Stabilization, Touch Enabled 3-Inch LCD, Wi-Fi, DC-FZ80K (Black)","Just received my new Panasonic DMC-FZ70 from Amazon.  First thing is that I had preordered it and the price changed by the time I had delivery.  Called Amazon and explained the problem and the very polite lady credited my account with the difference.  It turns out that if you preorder you must call them if the price changes.  They do not automatically credit your account.  Hope this little bit of information will save money for anyone else who preordered.,Now as to the camera itself.  So far I am absolutely thrilled and hopeful.  It replaces an old FZ-7 which still works but the new features and the wide angle on the FZ70 made me want it.,One odd thing is that when the camera is turned on there is a very soft continuous sound coming from the camera when you are doing nothing with it.  So I called the Panasonic support folks and they were essentially worthless and suggested sending the camera back.  I called a local camera store and by luck they had one sitting right there.  The very polite lady listened to my question and said well it shouldn't be making any noise.  Then she turned their FZ70 on and she held it up to her ear and said ""oh my golly there is a continuous noise"".  Bingo!  With two cameras doing it perhaps then this is normal.  The sound as near as I can describe it is very soft and makes me think of an old coffee percolator that would be in the other room.,So far every feature on the camera seems to work just fine.  I was surprised to see that it was built in China because my FZ-7 was built in Osaka Japan and somehow I had been led to believe that this series was built in Japan.  That is not a deal killer for me.,The weight and feel of this is impressive compared to my older FZ-7.  Fits a man's hand better.,The software that comes with it is impressive.  I bought a Hoya Alfa MC UV and lens protector from Amazon in the 55mm size and it should protect the lens and not degrade the photos.  Bought the Transcend 32GB SDHC. Bought the AGFA Photo Heavy Duty Rubber lens hood in 55mm and that is a bit problematic.  I believe I will keep it for outdoor shots but for flash it is in the way of the distance finder which apparently determines the amount of flash.  Also in full wide angle there is a very slight interference but a slight zoom out from full wide angle and that fixes that. At any rate I will keep the lens hood and just screw it in as needed and not tighten it so it can be removed quickly. To many times in sunlight I find a lens hood to be a necessity., Can't wait to get some pictures and video to see the quality and update this review.,UPDATE:  Still very happy and the quality of the photos is exactly what I hoped for.  The low light capability is excellent and beyond what I was expecting.  Using it mostly in the AI and Scenery modes.  Very impressive.  More capability here than I would expect for this price.  I had actually considered the Nikon D7100 but thought the weight wasn't something I wanted to be hiking with.  More going on inside this little jewel than I have time to understand but wow.  Example is in the AI mode I was using the zoom to take a close up and the symbol on the screen changed to the little flower which on my old FZ7 would have been a setting for taking close-ups of things like flowers.  I will be using it today at a soccer meet with my Granddaughter playing and can't wait to see how it performs.  For this price point you can't beat this camera.,Shot a small video also and used the zoom quite a bit to see how the stabilization worked.  Well the video was better than my dedicated Panasonic HD camcorder.  So I will just be carrying one camera now.,One small thing that I do wonder about is the lens.  Is it a Leica?  Doesn't say Leica on the lens like my old FZ7 and frankly for the quality of the pictures I'm getting it doesn't matter but that little L on the camera body ....always thought that was for Leica but maybe it is for Lumix.","September 5, 2013",5.0 out of 5 stars,Informed Shopper

B019UDI5PO,Canon-PowerShot-Digital-Camera-Optical,Canon PowerShot SX420 Digital Camera w/ 42x Optical Zoom - Wi-Fi & NFC Enabled (Black),"I gave this camera every chance I could to take good pictures.  I studied the manual, I went to the website when I needed help, I hooked it up to my phone, and then I took the same photos with the camera and then my phone, a Samsung Galaxy 7.  My phone won.  The photo of the thunderhead and rainstorm across town taken with my phone showed the colors from bright white to dark gray, creating depth of field.  The photo taken with the camera was overexposed on the bright white areas, showing less definition in the colors and flattening the depth.  Then I photographed the dog, who moves around quite a bit.  The photo with my phone was in sharp focus with good color definition.  The photo with the camera was fuzzy and dull, leading me to conclude that the auto-focus is too slow.  I really wanted to like this camera; I wanted a lightweight camera to take photos on my trip to the British Isles so I wouldn't have to lug around my Canon Rebel XTI.

If you need something you don't care much about for work, or basic use, it's OK.  I buy cameras like this because I don't want to ruin my phone or a quality camera when I take pictures at work, and as such this camera is more or less adequate.  I think it's overpriced for what it is, but there aren't many that cost less either.,I've gone through a lot of $50-$100 digital cameras in the past years, and for how I use them they never last more than a year, if that.  It's annoying and frustrating, but frankly I am very hard on them and I know going in that the cameras I buy are cheap and won't be very good.,Frustrations particular this camera so far:,1.  Very short battery life, and then the camera just shuts off, doesn't even close the lens if you're in the middle of a picture.  Very annoying.,2.  Every photo comes pre-captioned with text, and this can be a time-wasting irritation when using your photos somewhere.  I have to delete each caption individually when I use them in a Word Press website.  I haven't found a way to change or remove the caption feature, even after reading the online manual.,Photos are what you expect.  Yeah, my phone is way better, but as I said I don't like to use it for work because my hands are often dirty, or paint-y, or resin-y, and I'm not going to ruin my phone that way.  I only use the Kodak camera for work, and would hate to try and use it in the real world.,So the long and the short is that this camera takes pictures that are adequate if you're just doing some sort of rough documentation, but not for family, vacations, or anything in the real world.  I bought it because it's cheap, and I'd had enough of some of the other brands I've tried that continually failed, so I refused to further support those camera manufacturers.,Perhaps I should just buy a cheap smartphone with no calling or data plan simply for the camera use?","February 15, 2017",2.0 out of 5 stars,TCL

Stabilization, Touch Enabled 3-Inch LCD, Wi-Fi, DC-FZ80K (Black)","I've only had mine a few days so my testing is admittedly limited. Please do not give up on this camera unless you have made some very careful tripod shots. Yes, this camera is hard to hold steady as is any 300+ mm lens. The stabilizer is good but cannot overcome everything. Hand holding 1200mm is a tough job and requires excellent technique and a degree of luck!,I used a heavy Bogen tripod on solid cement and made very careful shots at about 50yds and 75yds (auto focus) throughout the available f range at max zoom. I was quite surprised at the resolving power of the lens using ISO 100.,My Nikon D5000 and Nikkor 70 - 300 EDIF zoom in RAW mode, on the same subject, is barely sharper.,Laugh if you will, but I used the SilkyPix software to examine the RAW and jpeg images. I did not find a difference even worth mentioning in raw and jpeg modes. I did not use the default picture settings in the camera. SilkyPix works just fine if you take a bit of time to learn to use it. I also own PhotoShop and have used it for over 20 years, so it's not like I didn't have a choice.,All images benefited from a bit of post processing just as all my D5000 and P7700 images do.,I can see how some users might easily rush to judgement on this camera. But it shouldn't be about lens sharpness. Hold it steady and it will deliver very good results. Many of the review sites have not done a real good job of testing the camera yet. Buy it and make your own carefully controlled tests, then decide.,Hand held tests at very high magnifications are totally INVALID for lens critiquing purposes. Few people can hold that long lens steady enough. High ISOs will certainly help keep shutter speeds high, but it's the high ISO NOISE then that will ruin the image sharpness .. not the lens.,Use a SOLID tripod to test the long zoom for yourself. Do it at ISO 100 first.,At my work, photographing motorcycles indoors, hand held, under less than optimal lighting, I have used the camera at ISO 1200. Plenty of noise but these images are used at 1024 x 768 (72 dpi) on the internet. The noise at that size and resolution is invisible and the available light shots are quite usable..,The weakness I see and have not found a solution for is highlight clipping. In my tests, light subjects were hard to hold detail in. Perhaps further experimentation with the picture controls may help. Noise seems to creep in early too.,We can't have it all. Twenty to 1200mm is an amazing accomplishment for Panasonic. Remember this is a consumer level camera. At this price point it seems to represent a very good value and a very versatile photographic tool. Perfect? No. None of them are.,My previous Panasonic was an FZ35 which, once I learned to use it properly, was an truly excellent camera. This one probably has a steep learning curve too.,Giving a star rating was hard. With so little testing I hated to rate it yet. Too low ... too high??,My advice is forget the ""stars"" and test the camera on YOUR own favorite subjects, then decide if it's any good. But, be fair to the camera and be sure any problems you encounter aren't YOUR personal technique problems.,September 30,2013,In the end I just could not love this camera. I wanted to, but I couldn't. I bought it mostly for the long end of the zoom but what I think is a decent lens is hampered by some other factors. Maybe the sensor, maybe the camera software, I don't know. I shot a lot of long zoom photos in bright light and high shutter speeds and for me it just wasn't quite there. High ISOs significantly mar the images after 250. If you do a lot of tripod work maybe this will work out for you. If the lens were ""faster"" ( like the FZ200), it might be much better, but it is what it is. The combination of sensor noise and slow lens at zoom combine to make less than optimal images when hand holding.,Don't get me wrong, I did get some very nice images from the camera but I had to shoot a lot of frames and be very selective of the images. I'm not saying this is a BAD camera. It just didn't totally please me.,I did like the 20mm aspect of the lens and used in shorter focal lengths I thought it did very well. I'm sure many will find this camera very useful and perfectly satisfactory. I personally will wait a wee bit more for the next round of improvements and try again.,Compared with the really excellent images from my P7700, I just couldn't justify keeping it. DARN! Bottom line is I'd rather have a somewhat shorter zoom with a faster lens and a less noisy sensor that makes better images. I'm gonna miss that 20mm though .....","September 9, 2013",4.0 out of 5 stars,S. Hock

I love the flexible tripod and the cute camera bag that it comes with too. The bag is a little on the small side so it's perfect for travel or to pop in a purse, not so much for all of the additional accessories that the camera comes with. The camera itself is actually lighter than it looks, and it's very easy to use. I haven't tried it in low light conditions but I have no doubt it will perform well.

I am going on a trip to Mexico and I needed a new camera so I could take pictures of the trip, but the photos were all incredibly blurry., 4 out of 5 photos were just blurry as can be the zoom in was bad, but the zoomed out photos were even worse.

I sped up the ISO, and it worked really well.  My last other popular brand point-and-shoot had a terrible blur problem, no matter what I did with it.  So I went back to Canon, and could not be happier with the performance.","March 4, 2019",5.0 out of 5 stars,Paul C
B019UDHT6U,Canon-PowerShot-Digital-Camera-Stabilization,Canon PowerShot ELPH 180 Digital Camera w/Image Stabilization and Smart AUTO Mode (Red),Bought this from Canon as a refurbished camera at $30+ savings over the price of a new unit. The refurbished item looks new in every way and one couldn't tell this one apart from a brand new unit. Works like a dream and is well-worth the ~$70 I paid for it. Perfect for informal photography although I wouldn't compare it with any DSLR in either quality or detail.,"August 14, 2018",5.0 out of 5 stars,J. G. Smerda

B00I8BIC9E,Sony-DSCW800-Digital-Camera-Silver,Sony (DSCW800) 20.1 MP Digital Camera (Silver),So disappointed in this camera. Bought it for my 18 year old son who would be gone for two years. He just sent his sd card back to us and half of the pictures are blurry. If there was any movement from someone in the picture it was ruined. Pictures are for memories and this camera has lost so many memories for us. We are buying a new one and it definitely won't be a Sony.

This camera is perfect for that with its rubber sides. It takes good pictures and has different borders and other things that she can do with the pictures and she loves it.

B07JK77M9H,Digital-Camera-Display-Beginners-Seniors,"HD Mini Digital Camera with 3 Inch TFT LCD Display,Digital Point and Shoot Camera Video Camera for Kids/Beginners/Seniors (Black)","I wanted an inexpensive snapshot camera for my wife, the technophobe.  This Vmotal unit will probably do the job but it is definitely only good for casual snapshots.  The camera is labeled ""12 Megapixels""  Maybe, but even with everything set to the highest resolution looks like 10 of those 12 megapixels got lost in the process.  Files are JPG format and show a lot of compression artifacts, probably because of processor speed limitations.  Using auto-exposure, highlights are blown out unless the scene has a very low dynamic range.  Auto-focus isn't a problem because I don't think it has any, just the old Kodak Brownie style fixed-focus lens.  Sensitivity seems low and normal indoor lighting seems to be barely adequate, with long exposure time requiring a very steady hand to minimize motion blur (I'm still playing with settings, but the ""anti-shake"" setting doesn't seem to help at all).  Overall, best results seem to be using highest detail settings all around coupled with manually setting ISO to 400, the highest setting.,I'm not saying you shouldn't consider buying this camera, just be very aware it isn't anywhere as good as, for example, your iPhone's camera, and if left with all settings at default the results on many scenes won't be too great.  On the other hand, if it gets lost or dropped in the lake, it won't hurt like losing the iPhone, or a Canon camera.","July 26, 2019",3.0 out of 5 stars,SoCal Flyer

I tried one of them first and returned it for the SX420. It is so much easier to use and the zoom is great. It really pulls the far away subject in close. I am looking forward to taking it with us on our trip. I have the Rebel ESO and I absolutely love it, but sometimes you just need a small camera to carry as the Rebel is quite bulky.

Since then I have used this camera just a handful of times, and always in a safe manner. Today after not using it for about a month I turned it on to find that the buttons are not working properly. Flash turns on the recording rather than flash. The menu button does nothing. The playback button brings up the last picture I took but the back/next and delete buttons do nothing. Basically my recently purchased camera is already not working properly. I contacted the seller asking for a replacement and they dismissed me and told me to contact Amazon?

I bought this one for my 7 y.o daughter, she's obsessed with taking pictures. Before we bought this camera she would take my phohe and keep it for hours, taking 100+ puctires of her thumbs or nose. It was supper annoying for me, especially I need to work from my phone sometimes and couldn't find it anywhere. Finaly my patience has broken and I got this camera. What can I say, hurray, finaly nobody touches my phone. She loves it, she takes pictures of EVERYTHING! But to tell the truth quality of the camera is not bad at all, colors are great, not grainy, even in low light environments. There's very simple menu, lots of stickers you can add to the pictures before you take a shot. You can record a video. Camera comes very well packed, the kit includes: camera itselt, USB charger, flash card for 16GB, special adaptor for conputer, manual and neckband.,The camers is very easy to use. It has impressive battery life, since we got it we haven't even changed ot yet. And it's more the a week.

As a side note,I wish someone would make one of these ""advanced bridge"" cameras with an aperture smaller than f8.  That just isn't good enough for landscape shots.

The battery drained faster than I expected.  Apparently the trick is to minimize monitor usage.  Unfortunately, there is no viewfinder.  It does not take panorama shots or have forced flash in AUTO mode.  I haven't used the manual mode(s).  The video works fine.,This is a good, little, point and shoot super-zoom camera.  Cheaper ones used AA batteries.  I wanted a camera with a rechargeable battery pack, so I spent a little more.  Plus I got extra zoom power (i.e., 42x) and 20 MP resolution.

Stabilization, Touch Enabled 3-Inch LCD, Wi-Fi, DC-FZ80K (Black)","I got this Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ70 digital camera earlier this year here to replace a similar digital camera that died on me & I needed a good replacement digital camera. I chose this camera & several spare batteries over many others. I have had other  compact Panasonic Lumix digital cameras over the past few years with generally good luck with those.,This digital camera looks very nice & rather professional-looking. This is a sizable super-zoom bridge digital camera and it feels very good when I use it. Nice sizable grip on it helps a lot too when picture-taking.,Pros: Pretty extensive menu system that's fairly easy to use, great wide lens and decent 60X optical zoom, long battery life, optical view finder, external flash attachment, looks pretty well-built and professional looking as well and seems durable. Many photo scene modes and full manual modes also included on this camera. Uses the easy to find SD or SDHC cards. Nice photo qualities also even tho it cannot compare against DSLR cameras. Focuses pretty quick for me and really no operational issues at all with this camera. Everything seems to work well on this digital camera for me.,Cons: Short burst shooting modes, LCD screen is fixed into the camera & does not tilt out or flip out like Canon & Nikon comparable digital cameras.,Photo qualities with this camera varies: outdoor photos with no flash I get fantastic photos, low light photos is a bit trickier with this camera & photo qualities suffer quite a bit, indoor photos with flash ends up quite nice with this camera....but can be a bit washed-out if you're too close to the subject you're photographing. Overall photo qualities with this Panasonic digital camera are very good and I am very pleased with what photos I have taken so far with this camera. Video qualities with this camera are as good as any other digital camera I have had....very good.,I did get a few extra batteries and an extra charger plus a lens hood for this camera....the lens hood makes the camera look a bit more professional and does help photos a bit in bright sunny weather. Plus I got a case for this camera.,If you want a decent super zoom digital camera and cannot afford a larger CMOS sensor [1 inch CMOS] super zoom digital camera or DSLR digital camera and still get fairly good photos at a pretty good price, I think this camera will do the job just fine.,The only other rival digital cameras I think that can compare with this camera is a Canon SX-50 HS and maybe the Canon SX-60 HS. I have both of those cameras and photo qualities are comparable between all 3 digital cameras at this point. Nikon's P600 may be a rival too, but from what I have heard from other users is that Nikon camera has focusing issues.,This is my third redo of this review & originally I gave it 3 stars, then 4 stars....now I am giving this Panasonic FZ70 digital camera 5 of 5 stars because I have had it long enough & used it enough now....and I am still getting consistently good photos with this camera . So now I can finally finalize this review once and for all.","April 20, 2014",5.0 out of 5 stars,Stormy1

I should have known better. It DOES come with the 1 Canon kit lens. The other 2 lenses are XIT brand and the two of them together can be purchased for less than $20. They actually make the pictures worse. Also, just to note, these are not stand alone lenses. They screw onto the front of the lens like a filter would. These are completely not usable for any kind of quality pictures. An average point and shoot camera takes higher quality pictures than you will get through these lenses.,If this is your first DSLR, the kit provides a decent value. All of the components are cheap, but will give you an idea if those are things you will use and should replace with better versions.,The camera itself is (so far) awesome. The camera alone would have been a 5 star purchase. The package alone would be a 2 star purchase. The way it's listed and pictured is deceptive. Overall, it's worth the $10 over just the camera, but be sure to keep your expectations low.,All the included components are as follows:,$10.69 xit macro lens xt58wab,$8.93 xit telephoto lens xt2x58,$19.75 vivitar large gadget bag,$22.46 xit tripod xt60trb,$4.50 vivitar 4in pocket tripod,$9.16 transcend 16gb flash card,$16.99 transcend 32gb flash card,$8.68 xit remote shutter release,$4.93 xit SD/microSD card reader,$7.46 pro series digital filter set,$3.95 lens cap keeper (stick on),$2.94 xit universal screen protector,$3.99 xit digital ultraviolet filter,$3.00 vivitar cleaning kit and card wallet,$14.95 slave flash,Total accessories: $142.38,$449 Canon EOS Rebel T6 Digital SLR Camera Kit with EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS II Lens (Black)","November 18, 2017",3.0 out of 5 stars,Caete

I have been using it for about a month now, and it has been wonderful. It is a fantastic first time camera and does a great job at helping you learn it. The rating is due to what comes with the camera, so please beware.,Pros: The SD cards alone provide good value, as they can get expensive as you need bigger cards, for a first-timer, and as long as you aren't shooting raw+jpeg like I am, you won't need anything else. Also helps to mention you get a sd card wallet and a usb reader/writer. The uv and other filters are also nice if you want to use filters in your shots, when I first started out I was using a uv filter on my kit lens. I have since bought a much better lens, and do not use a filter anymore. The cleaning kit is very handy, I have no problems there but also bought a professional cleaning kit. The mini tripod is quite cute and has been handy a few times, beware, I have had trouble getting it to hold up my camera sturdy enough with anything other than the kit lens. As stated above, the camera and everything it comes with is good. It also comes with a remote shutter which is very nice as well. I tried it out with my silly little tripod and was pleased with the result.,Cons: My biggest issue with my purchase is it sounded like you are getting two extra lenses with the purchase. You're not. The picture you see of the three lenses grouped together: the bigger one is the kit lens and the two extras next to it are them. They are not lenses, they do not attach to the camera. I would call these ""lens extensions"", as they screw onto your kit lens like a uv filter does. They are also 100% worthless, please take it from someone who has already tried them, and then bought other lenses and compared the difference. I would upload the bad pictures they took, but have since deleted them out of my library. The bag it comes with is incredibly small, and barely fits all of your accessories, heaven forbid you go and get more equipment to add to it. I have since purchased a backpack that I can grow into, and the bag is now a spare parts bag. The bigger tripod is a cheap plastic, and while it is just fine for indoor photography and videos, I wouldn't dare use it on a windy day taking landscape shots. The flash could be a pro or con depending on your personal thoughts. It is not an ETTL, meaning that you have to manually adjust your settings to match the flash and how it fires, the camera will not do it for you. It also is completely stationary, it is brighter than the built-in flash, which is better for outdoor shots that you need to light up. I can imagine it would be difficult for a beginner, it was difficult for me.,Conclusion: If I had known better at the time, I would have either spent less money to get a kit without ""lenses"" or spent a little bit more to get real lenses included in the kit. The camera itself and the SD cards provide wonderful value, but I would not make this purchase again and wouldn't recommend it to anyone.","October 3, 2017",2.0 out of 5 stars,Stephen DiGiorgio

B01D93Z89W,Canon-T6-Digital-Telephoto-Accessory,Canon EOS Rebel T6 Digital SLR Camera with 18-55mm EF-S f/3.5-5.6 is II Lens + 58mm Wide Angle Lens + 2X Telephoto Lens + Flash + 48GB SD Memory Card + UV Filter Kit + Tripod + Full Accessory Bundle,"This camera is an excellent choice for a step up from point-and-shoot, or a first camera for a novice DSLR.  It's fully automatic but you can gradually take creative control of every aspect of your photography as you become more comfortable with the settings and features.  The tiny instruction manual included in the package gives just the basics and can be frustrating, but download the PDF file and there are your clear directions, step by step and in color.  For an experienced amateur photographer some of the items included in the kit will be redundant (who doesn't have at least two tripods?) but buying the camera, lenses, flash and cards separately would be more expensive than what you receive in this packed bundle.  The only thing I would change is one feature of its WiFi capabilities.  Unlike the Canon SX60HS, it can't wirelessly download to the hard drive of a computer.  You would use your cable or card reader.  But it's just a minor annoyance.  It can easily send your photos to any mobile device.","August 13, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,Public Name

The clarity is beautiful, crisp and clear. I take mostly landscape, sunrise and sunset shots.  I also pre-ordered this Lumix -and got a credit for the price difference.  The zoom is great! Last evening, I had the opportunity to take some long range pictures down the beach - and they came out very clear for the distance I was shooting.  Love the panoramic setting on the top dial of the camera for taking multiple shots of the beach side... A few pix came out with funny lines but most came out beautifully...,Amazon Customer service staff were so helpful with all my questions.  I ordered the free shipping (5-8 days).  I received my camera in 3 days! Just in time for my trip!,Back with an update.  Again, I've only been taking photos for a couple of years, so I'm still fairly new at all this. Took the Lumix to the beach last weekend... The camera performed well in the blue sky weather that prevailed. The panoramic setting is great for beach shots although I found some images had lines with some different light exposures.,The biggest problem I'm having is red diagonal lens flares when I shoot sunset shots.  My Lumix (DMC-ZS10 w/ 16x zoom) or my husband's Canon Power Shot cameras never showed that much flare...As most of my pix are sunrises and sunsets, this is a big problems....any suggestions would be appreciated.","September 7, 2013",5.0 out of 5 stars,JimZ
